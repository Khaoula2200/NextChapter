Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.

For in Harry’s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who haunts the girls’ bathroom.

At the Quidditch World Cup, Voldemort's signature Dark Mark appears in the sky over the stadium, causing pandemonium. The lightning-bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead is sporadically causing him agonizing pain, and he is also hearing disturbing voices. Harry realizes that all this is the result of a strong connection between himself and the Dark Lord, one that is putting him in grave danger. Back at Hogwarts, the students are getting ready for the upcoming Triwizard Tournament. Witches and wizards from two other schools are coming to Hogwarts for the year to compete in a series of grueling contests. The tournament is open only to students age 17 and above, but when someone secretly enters Harry's name, he is forced to compete. How can a 14-year-old possibly pass tests that might be fatal to an advanced wizard? And with the threat of Lord Voldemort looming, will he be able to focus on the tournament at all? For Harry, his friends, and everyone in the Wizarding world, the stakes are about to become much higher. This fourth installment, with a heart-pounding and emotional climax, serves as a turning point in the series, for the reader and for Harry himself.","tags":["Fantasy","Fiction","Young Adult","Harry Potter","Magic","Audiobook","Childrens","...more"],"rating":4.57,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1627044952i/58613424.jpg","publishYear":2000,"numPages":752,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58613424-harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire"},{"id":"6","title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)","author":"J.K.

Ron scans the obituary pages of The Daily Prophet looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. And yet... As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. So it's the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Harry struggles to uncover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince, the past owner of a potions textbook he now possesses that is filled with ingenious, potentially deadly, spells. But Harry's life is suddenly changed forever when someone close to him is heinously murdered right before his eyes. With Dumbledore's guidance, he seeks out the full, complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort, and thereby attempts to find what may be his only vulnerability.","tags":["Fantasy","Fiction","Young Adult","Harry Potter","Magic","Audiobook","Childrens","...more"],"rating":4.58,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1627043894i/58613345.jpg","publishYear":2005,"numPages":672,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58613345-harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince"},{"id":"7","title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, #7)","author":"J.K.

Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean. Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn.

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself. Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.","tags":["Fantasy","Fiction","Epic Fantasy","High Fantasy","Adult","Audiobook","Science Fiction Fantasy","...more"],"rating":4.45,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234i/13496.jpg","publishYear":1996,"numPages":835,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones"},{"id":"9","title":"The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)","author":"J.R.R.

His influence is suddenly everywhere in the Wizarding world, and his former allies, the Death Eaters, are returning to his side in droves. In response, the Order of the Phoenix, which worked to stop him during his last rise to power, has reconvened. This time, all of the adults Harry trusts have joined in. And even though Harry is at the center of many of their plans - Voldemort is intent on killing him, after all - they want so badly to protect him that they are keeping him completely out of the loop. Problems are cropping up at Hogwarts, too, where government officials are meddling in just about everything. And just because Voldemort and the Death Eaters are threatening open warfare does not mean that fifth-year students get out of their exams. Meanwhile, Harry's powerful connection to Voldemort seems to be growing even stronger, as he realizes that he has direct access to the Dark Lord's mind. It's time for Harry and his friends to take drastic action, but the course they choose will have terrible unforeseen consequences.

Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders. But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans; they incinerate them. With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant. She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise. Yet with every day that passes, the war outside grows deadlier; the kingdom's protective wards are failing; and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.","tags":["Fantasy","Romance","Romantasy","Dragons","Fiction","Audiobook","Enemies To Lovers","...more"],"rating":4.57,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1701980900i/61431922.jpg","publishYear":2023,"numPages":517,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61431922-fourth-wing"},{"id":"14","title":"Mistborn: The Final Empire (Mistborn, #1)","author":"Brandon Sanderson","description":"What if the whole world were a dead, blasted wasteland?

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \\"Sliver of Infinity,\\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier \\"snapped\\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Then Kelsier reveals his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets. She will have to learn trust if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed. Brandon Sanderson, fantasy's newest master tale-spinner and author of the acclaimed debut Elantris , dares to turn a genre on its head by asking a simple question: What if the prophesied hero failed to defeat the Dark Lord?

Assassin Celaena Sardothien won a brutal contest to become his Champion. Yet Celaena is far from loyal to the crown. She hides her secret vigilantly; she knows that the man she serves is bent on evil. Keeping up the deadly charade becomes increasingly difficult when Celaena realizes she is not the only one seeking justice. As she tries to untangle the mysteries buried deep within the glass castle, her closest relationships suffer. It seems no one is above questioning her allegiances—not the Crown Prince Dorian; not Chaol, the Captain of the Guard; not even her best friend, Nehemia, a foreign princess with a rebel heart. Then one terrible night, the secrets they have all been keeping lead to an unspeakable tragedy. As Celaena's world shatters, she will be forced to give up the very thing most precious to her and decide once and for all where her true loyalties lie... and whom she is ultimately willing to fight for.","tags":["Fantasy","Young Adult","Romance","Fiction","Romantasy","Magic","Fae","...more"],"rating":4.36,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1673566594i/76705490.jpg","publishYear":2013,"numPages":420,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76705490-crown-of-midnight"},{"id":"31","title":"A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, #5)","author":"George R.R.

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind. Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever. Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice. From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.","tags":["Fantasy","Fiction","Epic Fantasy","High Fantasy","Science Fiction Fantasy","Dragons","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.34,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1753059444i/10664113.jpg","publishYear":2011,"numPages":1125,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10664113-a-dance-with-dragons"},{"id":"32","title":"The Night Circus (Hardcover)","author":"Erin Morgenstern","description":"The circus arrives without warning.

It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.","tags":["Fantasy","Fiction","Romance","Book Club","Historical Fiction","Magical Realism","Magic","...more"],"rating":4,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387124618i/9361589.jpg","publishYear":2011,"numPages":506,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9361589-the-night-circus"},{"id":"33","title":"The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive, #1)","author":"Brandon Sanderson","description":"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings , book one of The Stormlight Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.

Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war. The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making. Speak again the ancient oaths: Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before Destination. and return to men the Shards they once bore. The Knights Radiant must stand again.","tags":["Fantasy","Fiction","Epic Fantasy","High Fantasy","Audiobook","Adult","Science Fiction Fantasy","...more"],"rating":4.66,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1659905828i/7235533.jpg","publishYear":2010,"numPages":1007,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings"},{"id":"34","title":"City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments, #1)","author":"Cassandra Clare","description":"When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder—much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos","fullDescription":"When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder—much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons.

Or was he a boy? This is Clary’s first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It’s also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace’s world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon.

Red London, where life and magic are revered—and where Kell was raised alongside Rhys Maresh, the rougish heir to a flourishing empire. White London—a place where people fight to control magic and the magic fights back, draining the city to its very bones. And once upon a time, there was Black London. But no one speaks of that now.

It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand. Fleeing into Grey London, Kell runs into Delilah Bard, a cutpurse with lofty aspirations.

And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it. The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other. Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts. Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.","tags":["Fantasy","Romance","Romantasy","Fiction","Fae","Audiobook","Fantasy Romance","...more"],"rating":4.45,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1734440950i/53138095.jpg","publishYear":2021,"numPages":757,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53138095-a-court-of-silver-flames"},{"id":"44","title":"The Well of Ascension (Mistborn, #2)","author":"Brandon Sanderson","description":"\\"Description contains spoilers for previous book in the series\\" The impossible has been accomplished.

The Lord Ruler—the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years—has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves. As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her. Stopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp, but it's the least of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn't run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies - one of them composed of ferocious giants - now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal. As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope.

So when Fitz is finally adopted into the royal household, he must give up his old ways and embrace a new life of weaponry, scribing, courtly manners; and how to kill a man secretly, as he trains to become a royal assassin.","tags":["Fantasy","Fiction","High Fantasy","Epic Fantasy","Audiobook","Adult","Magic","...more"],"rating":4.19,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1673728072i/77197.jpg","publishYear":1995,"numPages":435,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77197.Assassin_s_Apprentice"},{"id":"47","title":"The Sea of Monsters (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #2)","author":"Rick Riordan","description":"After a year spent trying to prevent a catastropic war among the Greek gods, Percy Jackson finds his seventh-grade school year unnervingly quiet.

His biggest problem is dealing with his new friend, Tyson--a six-foot-three, mentally challenged homeless kid who follows Percy everywhere, making it hard for Percy to have any \\"normal\\" friends. But things don't stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: The magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters--the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millenia--only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new name...the Bermuda Triangle. Now Percy and his friends--Grover, Annabeth, and Tyson--must retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclopes by the end of the summer or Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed. But first, Percy will learn a stunning new secret about his family--one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon's son is an honor or simply a cruel joke.","tags":["Fantasy","Young Adult","Mythology","Fiction","Middle Grade","Percy Jackson","Adventure","...more"],"rating":4.24,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1530819367i/40727118.jpg","publishYear":2006,"numPages":279,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40727118-the-sea-of-monsters"},{"id":"48","title":"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue (Hardcover)","author":"V.E.

After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished. When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.","tags":["Fantasy","Young Adult","Romance","Enemies To Lovers","Fae","Fiction","Young Adult Fantasy","...more"],"rating":4.27,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520620414i/26032887.jpg","publishYear":2019,"numPages":336,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26032887-the-wicked-king"},{"id":"50","title":"The Poppy War (The Poppy War, #1)","author":"R.F.

When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising. But surprises aren’t always good. Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school. For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . . Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.","tags":["Fantasy","Fiction","Historical Fiction","Adult","Audiobook","Historical","High Fantasy","...more"],"rating":4.17,"genres":["fantasy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1515691735i/35068705.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":545,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war"},{"id":"51","title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Kindle Edition)","author":"Ray Bradbury","description":"Nearly seventy years after its original publication, Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 stands as a classic of world literature set in a bleak, dystopian future.

Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Science Fiction","Dystopia","School","Literature","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":3.97,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383718290i/13079982.jpg","publishYear":1953,"numPages":194,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451"},{"id":"52","title":"Ender’s Game (Ender's Saga, #1)","author":"Orson Scott Card","description":"Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast. But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.","tags":["Science Fiction","Fiction","Young Adult","Fantasy","Classics","Science Fiction Fantasy","Dystopia","...more"],"rating":4.31,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130i/375802.jpg","publishYear":1985,"numPages":324,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game"},{"id":"53","title":"Dune (Dune #1)","author":"Frank Herbert","description":"Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a dr","fullDescription":"Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness.

After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next.

Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding. It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans—except Katniss. The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay—no matter what the personal cost.","tags":["Young Adult","Dystopia","Fiction","Fantasy","Science Fiction","Romance","Adventure","...more"],"rating":4.12,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586722918i/7260188.jpg","publishYear":2010,"numPages":390,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7260188-mockingjay"},{"id":"67","title":"The Time Machine (Paperback)","author":"H.G.

Wells’s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.  There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.  Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells’s expert storytelling and provocative insight, The Time Machine will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.","tags":["Classics","Science Fiction","Fiction","Time Travel","Fantasy","Dystopia","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":3.89,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327942880i/2493.jpg","publishYear":1895,"numPages":118,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine"},{"id":"68","title":"Leviathan Wakes (The Expanse, #1)","author":"James S.A.

The Handmaid's Tale is an instant classic and eerily prescient cultural phenomenon, from \\"the patron saint of feminist dystopian fiction\\" ( New York Times ) The Handmaid’s Tale is a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast. Set in the near future, it describes life in what was once the United States and is now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population. The story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment’s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. The Handmaid’s Tale is funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing. It is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and a tour de force. It is Margaret Atwood at her best.","tags":["Fiction","Classics","Dystopia","Science Fiction","Feminism","Book Club","Fantasy","...more"],"rating":4.15,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1488552336i/34454589.jpg","publishYear":1985,"numPages":320,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34454589-the-handmaid-s-tale"},{"id":"78","title":"2001: A Space Odyssey (Space Odyssey, #1)","author":"Arthur C.

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself. During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.","tags":["Young Adult","Dystopia","Fantasy","Fiction","Science Fiction","Romance","Adventure","...more"],"rating":4.13,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1618526890i/13335037.jpg","publishYear":2011,"numPages":487,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13335037-divergent"},{"id":"80","title":"The War of the Worlds (Paperback)","author":"H.G.

Um amontoado de máquinas trípedes – comandadas por marcianos – passou a marchar sobre os arredores de Londres, exterminando humanos a seu bel-prazer mediante raios de calor e liberação de substâncias venenosas. Espalharam pânico, terror e consolidaram a Guerra. Esse é o ponto de partida de A guerra dos mundos, publicada originalmente em 1897 no periódico britânico Pearson’s Magazine e considerada por especialistas a obra fundamental da ficção científica. O livro em questão serviu como base para múltiplas adaptações para teatro, rádio, televisão e cinema e, apesar de ter sido uma das primeiras obras do autor enquanto romancista, já deixa evidente seu talento singular. Dono de uma originalidade marcante em seu estilo, H. G. Wells consolidou ao longo de sua carreira literária um imaginário que se provou altamente fértil, tornando-se conhecido por seu dinamismo, vigor e exuberância. A guerra dos mundos também ficou famosa como crítica feita de forma voraz ao avanço assombroso do imperialismo europeu – e à subsequente erradicação de espécies animais e populações indígenas nativas das colônias britânicas. Além disso, pode ser considerada uma metáfora acerca da seleção natural e do darwinismo social, demonstrando o conhecimento do autor nos mais variados campos do saber.","tags":["Classics","Science Fiction","Fiction","Fantasy","Audiobook","Horror","Science Fiction Fantasy","...more"],"rating":3.83,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320391644i/8909.jpg","publishYear":1898,"numPages":192,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8909.The_War_of_the_Worlds"},{"id":"81","title":"Frankenstein: The 1818 Text (Paperback)","author":"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley","description":"This is a previously-published edition of ISBN 9780143131847.

Cresciuto dai marziani, non è abituato al contatto con gli esseri umani, e al suo rientro sulla Terra è del tutto inconsapevole di ciò che lo sta aspettando. Michael, infatti, non ha idea di cosa siano le donne, non conosce le culture terrestri né il concetto di religione. Spedito sulla Terra dovrà imparare a diventare un umano e a comprendere i pregiudizi e le abitudini sociali, a lui alieni. Il suo ritorno è carico di conseguenze: è l’erede di un gigantesco impero finanziario, oltre che il padrone di Marte. Sotto la protezione dell’irascibile Jubal Harshaw, il giovane Michael scopre ed esplora il senso morale degli esseri umani e il vero significato dell’amore puro.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Science Fiction","Historical Fiction","War","Literature","Novels","...more"],"rating":4.1,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440319389i/4981.jpg","publishYear":1969,"numPages":275,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five"},{"id":"85","title":"The Martian Chronicles (Mass Market Paperback)","author":"Ray Bradbury","description":"The strange and wonderful tale of man’s experiences on Mars, filled with intense images and astonishing visions.

Now part of the Voyager Classics collection. The Martian Chronicles tells the story of humanity’s repeated attempts to colonize the red planet. The first men were few. Most succumbed to a disease they called the Great Loneliness when they saw their home planet dwindle to the size of a fist. They felt they had never been born. Those few that survived found no welcome on Mars. The shape-changing Martians thought they were native lunatics and duly locked them up. But more rockets arrived from Earth, and more, piercing the hallucinations projected by the Martians. People brought their old prejudices with them – and their desires and fantasies, tainted dreams. These were soon inhabited by the strange native beings, with their caged flowers and birds of flame.

Rosemary Harper doesn’t expect much when she joins the crew of the aging Wayfarer. While the patched-up ship has seen better days, it offers her a bed, a chance to explore the far-off corners of the galaxy, and most importantly, some distance from her past. An introspective young woman who learned early to keep to herself, she’s never met anyone remotely like the ship’s diverse crew, including Sissix, the exotic reptilian pilot, chatty engineers Kizzy and Jenks who keep the ship running, and Ashby, their noble captain. Life aboard the Wayfarer is chaotic and crazy—exactly what Rosemary wants. It’s also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job of a lifetime. Tunneling wormholes through space to a distant planet is definitely lucrative and will keep them comfortable for years. But risking her life wasn’t part of the plan. In the far reaches of deep space, the tiny Wayfarer crew will confront a host of unexpected mishaps and thrilling adventures that force them to depend on each other. To survive, Rosemary’s got to learn how to rely on this assortment of oddballs—an experience that teaches her about love and trust, and that having a family isn’t necessarily the worst thing in the universe.","tags":["Science Fiction","Fiction","LGBT","Audiobook","Queer","Space Opera","Fantasy","...more"],"rating":4.17,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405532474i/22733729.jpg","publishYear":2014,"numPages":518,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet"},{"id":"89","title":"Speaker for the Dead (Ender's Saga, #2)","author":"Orson Scott Card","description":"In this second book in the saga set 3,000 years after the terrible war, Ender Wiggin is reviled by history as the Xenocide--the destroyer of the alien Buggers.

The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-- and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding. Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets. John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.","tags":["Science Fiction","Fiction","Space Opera","Audiobook","War","Science Fiction Fantasy","Military Fiction","...more"],"rating":4.23,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1509467059i/36510196.jpg","publishYear":2005,"numPages":318,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36510196-old-man-s-war"},{"id":"91","title":"Annihilation (Southern Reach, #1)","author":"Jeff VanderMeer","description":"Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades.

Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In Annihilation , the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy , we join the twelfth expedition. The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself. They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.","tags":["Science Fiction","Horror","Fiction","Fantasy","Audiobook","Mystery","Dystopia","...more"],"rating":3.79,"genres":["science fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403941587i/17934530.jpg","publishYear":2014,"numPages":195,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530-annihilation"},{"id":"92","title":"Foundation and Empire (Foundation, #2)","author":"Isaac Asimov","description":"Foundation and Empire tells the incredible story of a new breed of man who create a new force for galactic government.

Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. And when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding. . . six-pack abs.

Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast. They’re polar opposites. In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they’re living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer’s block. Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel.

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.","tags":["Romance","Fiction","Contemporary","Audiobook","New Adult","Book Club","Contemporary Romance","...more"],"rating":4.09,"genres":["romance"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1670795825i/62627512.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":373,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62627512-it-ends-with-us"},{"id":"104","title":"Pride and Prejudice (Hardcover)","author":"Jane Austen","description":"Pride and Prejudice has charmed generations of readers for more than two centuries.

Nora Stephens’ life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small-town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute. If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.","tags":["Romance","Fiction","Contemporary","Audiobook","Contemporary Romance","Adult","Chick Lit","...more"],"rating":4.1,"genres":["romance"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1638867089i/58690308.jpg","publishYear":2022,"numPages":377,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58690308-book-lovers"},{"id":"106","title":"The Fault in Our Stars (Hardcover)","author":"John Green","description":"Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis.

Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man. Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs. Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.

Except, now—for reasons they’re still not discussing—they don’t. They broke up six months ago. And still haven’t told their best friends. Which is how they find themselves sharing the largest bedroom at the Maine cottage that has been their friend group’s yearly getaway for the last decade. Their annual respite from the world, where for one vibrant, blue week they leave behind their daily lives; have copious amounts of cheese, wine, and seafood; and soak up the salty coastal air with the people who understand them most. Only this year, Harriet and Wyn are lying through their teeth while trying not to notice how desperately they still want each other. Because the cottage is for sale and this is the last week they’ll all have together in this place. They can’t stand to break their friends’ hearts, and so they’ll play their parts. Harriet will be the driven surgical resident who never starts a fight, and Wyn will be the laid-back charmer who never lets the cracks show.

Daphne always loved the way her fiancé, Peter, told their story. How they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was good at telling it... right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his childhood best friend Petra. Which is how Daphne begins her new story: stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak. Scruffy and chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love ballads—Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned-up Daphne, whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she’s either FBI or in witness protection. The roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them?

In the ballrooms and drawing rooms of Regency London, rules abound. From their earliest days, children of aristocrats learn how to address an earl and curtsey before a prince—while other dictates of the ton are unspoken yet universally understood. A proper duke should be imperious and aloof. A young, marriageable lady should be amiable… but not too amiable. Daphne Bridgerton has always failed at the latter. The fourth of eight siblings in her close-knit family, she has formed friendships with the most eligible young men in London. Everyone likes Daphne for her kindness and wit. But no one truly desires her. She is simply too deuced honest for that, too unwilling to play the romantic games that captivate gentlemen. Amiability is not a characteristic shared by Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings. Recently returned to England from abroad, he intends to shun both marriage and society—just as his callous father shunned Simon throughout his painful childhood. Yet an encounter with his best friend’s sister offers another option. If Daphne agrees to a fake courtship, Simon can deter the mamas who parade their daughters before him. Daphne, meanwhile, will see her prospects and her reputation soar. The plan works like a charm—at first.

By day, she’s an adjunct professor, toiling away at grading labs and teaching thermodynamics in the hopes of landing tenure.

Honestly, it’s a pretty sweet gig—until her carefully constructed Elsie-verse comes crashing down. Because Jack Smith, the annoyingly attractive and broody older brother of her favorite client, turns out to be the cold-hearted experimental physicist who ruined her mentor’s career and undermined the reputation of theorists everywhere. And that same Jack who now sits on the hiring committee at MIT, right between Elsie and her dream job. Elsie is prepared for an all-out war of scholarly sabotage but…those long, penetrating looks?

When too much champagne and an out-of-control rooftop party lands Piper in the slammer, her stepfather decides enough is enough. So he cuts her off, and sends Piper and her sister to learn some responsibility running their late father’s dive bar... in Washington. Piper hasn’t even been in Westport for five minutes when she meets big, bearded sea captain Brendan, who thinks she won’t last a week outside of Beverly Hills. So what if Piper can’t do math, and the idea of sleeping in a shabby apartment with bunk beds gives her hives. How bad could it really be? She’s determined to show her stepfather—and the hot, grumpy local—that she’s more than a pretty face. Except it’s a small town and everywhere she turns, she bumps into Brendan. The fun-loving socialite and the gruff fisherman are polar opposites, but there’s an undeniable attraction simmering between them. Piper doesn’t want any distractions, especially feelings for a man who sails off into the sunset for weeks at a time. Yet as she reconnects with her past and begins to feel at home in Westport, Piper starts to wonder if the cold, glamorous life she knew is what she truly wants.

The cause: Daniel Grant, a ridiculously hot carpenter who’s ten years younger than her and as casual as they come—the complete opposite of sophisticated city-girl Alexis. And yet their chemistry is undeniable. While her ultra-wealthy parents want her to carry on the family legacy of world-renowned surgeons, Alexis doesn’t need glory or fame. She’s fine with being a “mere” ER doctor. And every minute she spends with Daniel and the tight-knit town where he lives, she’s discovering just what’s really important. Yet letting their relationship become anything more than a short-term fling would mean turning her back on her family and giving up the opportunity to help thousands of people. Bringing Daniel into her world is impossible, and yet she can’t just give up the joy she’s found with him either. With so many differences between them, how can Alexis possibly choose between her world and his? \\"Abby Jimenez’s words are like fairy dust... they sprinkled humor and warmth all over my life.

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion: \\"Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven.

Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\\" When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale?

The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The body On an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed. But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.

Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her. But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world—until the unthinkable happens. In Where the Crawdads Sing , Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps. The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures.","tags":["Fiction","Book Club","Historical Fiction","Mystery","Romance","Audiobook","Contemporary","...more"],"rating":4.37,"genres":["mystery"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1582135294i/36809135.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":384,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing"},{"id":"171","title":"The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie (Flavia de Luce, #1)","author":"Alan Bradley","description":"To Flavia the investigation is the stuff of full of possibilities, contradictions, and connections.

It was founded by Albert Ellingham, an early twentieth century tycoon, who wanted to make a wonderful place full of riddles, twisting pathways, and gardens. “A place,” he said, “where learning is a game.” Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. The only real clue was a mocking riddle listing methods of murder, signed with the frightening pseudonym “Truly, Devious.” It became one of the great unsolved crimes of American history. True-crime aficionado Stevie Bell is set to begin her first year at Ellingham Academy, and she has an ambitious plan: She will solve this cold case. That is, she will solve the case when she gets a grip on her demanding new school life and her housemates: the inventor, the novelist, the actor, the artist, and the jokester. But something strange is happening. Truly Devious makes a surprise return, and death revisits Ellingham Academy. The past has crawled out of its grave. Someone has gotten away with murder.

His editor, Susan Ryeland, has worked with him for years, and she's intimately familiar with his detective, Atticus Pünd, who solves mysteries disturbing sleepy English villages. Alan's traditional formula pays homage to queens of classic British crime such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers. It's proved hugely successful. So successful that Susan must continue to put up with his troubling behavior if she wants to keep her job. When Susan receives Alan's latest manuscript, in which Atticus Pünd investigates a murder at Pye Hall, an English manor house, she has no reason to think it will be any different from the others. There will be dead bodies, a cast of intriguing suspects, and plenty of red herrings and clues. But the more Susan reads, the more she realizes that there's another story hidden in the pages of the manuscript—one of ambition, jealousy, and greed—and that soon it will lead to murder.

In an instant, she became a member of a club no one wants to belong to—a group of similar survivors known in the press as the Final Girls. Lisa, who lost nine sorority sisters to a college dropout's knife; Sam, who went up against the Sack Man during her shift at the Nightlight Inn; and now Quincy, who ran bleeding through the woods to escape Pine Cottage and the man she refers to only as Him. The three girls are all attempting to put their nightmares behind them, and, with that, one another. Despite the media's attempts, they never meet. Now, Quincy is doing well—maybe even great, thanks to her Xanax prescription. She has a caring almost-fiancé, Jeff; a popular baking blog; a beautiful apartment; and a therapeutic presence in Coop, the police officer who saved her life all those years ago. Her memory won’t even allow her to recall the events of that night; the past is in the past. That is, until Lisa, the first Final Girl, is found dead in her bathtub, wrists slit, and Sam, the second, appears on Quincy's doorstep. Blowing through Quincy's life like a whirlwind, Sam seems intent on making Quincy relive the past, with increasingly dire consequences, all of which makes Quincy question why Sam is really seeking her out. And when new details about Lisa's death come to light, Quincy's life becomes a race against time as she tries to unravel Sam's truths from her lies, evade the police and hungry reporters, and, most crucially, remember what really happened at Pine Cottage, before what was started ten years ago is finished.","tags":["Thriller","Mystery","Horror","Mystery Thriller","Fiction","Audiobook","Crime","...more"],"rating":3.82,"genres":["thriller"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1496658340i/32796253.jpg","publishYear":2017,"numPages":352,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32796253-final-girls"},{"id":"211","title":"The Couple Next Door (Hardcover)","author":"Shari Lapena","description":"You never know what's happening on the other side of the wall.

Soon after her twenty-fifth birthday, Libby Jones returns home from work to find the letter she’s been waiting for her entire life.

Everything in Libby’s life is about to change. But what she can’t possibly know is that others have been waiting for this day as well—and she is on a collision course to meet them. Twenty-five years ago, police were called to 16 Cheyne Walk with reports of a baby crying. When they arrived, they found a healthy ten-month-old happily cooing in her crib in the bedroom.

Maggie Holt is used to such questions. Twenty-five years ago, she and her parents, Ewan and Jess, moved into Baneberry Hall, a rambling Victorian estate in the Vermont woods. They spent three weeks there before fleeing in the dead of night, an ordeal Ewan later recounted in a nonfiction book called House of Horrors . His tale of ghostly happenings and encounters with malevolent spirits became a worldwide phenomenon, rivaling The Amityville Horror in popularity—and skepticism. Today, Maggie is a restorer of old homes and too young to remember any of the events mentioned in her father’s book. But she also doesn’t believe a word of it. Ghosts, after all, don’t exist. When Maggie inherits Baneberry Hall after her father’s death, she returns to renovate the place to prepare it for sale. But her homecoming is anything but warm. People from the past, chronicled in House of Horrors , lurk in the shadows. And locals aren’t thrilled that their small town has been made infamous thanks to Maggie’s father. Even more unnerving is Baneberry Hall itself—a place filled with relics from another era that hint at a history of dark deeds. As Maggie experiences strange occurrences straight out of her father’s book, she starts to believe that what he wrote was more fact than fiction. In the latest thriller from New York Times bestseller Riley Sager, a woman returns to the house made famous by her father’s bestselling horror memoir. Is the place really haunted by evil forces, as her father claimed?

And why does he keep returning to the rites of Persephone, the maiden, and her journey to the underworld? When another body is found, Mariana’s obsession with proving Fosca’s guilt spirals out of control, threatening to destroy her credibility as well as her closest relationships.

Mallory Quinn is fresh out of rehab when she takes a job as a babysitter for Ted and Caroline Maxwell. She is to look after their five-year-old son, Teddy. Mallory immediately loves it. She has her own living space, goes out for nightly runs, and has the stability she craves. And she sincerely bonds with Teddy, a sweet, shy boy who is never without his sketchbook and pencil. His drawings are the usual fare: trees, rabbits, balloons. But one day, he draws something different: a man in a forest, dragging a woman’s lifeless body. Then, Teddy’s artwork becomes increasingly sinister, and his stick figures quickly evolve into lifelike sketches well beyond the ability of any five-year-old. Mallory begins to wonder if these are glimpses of a long-unsolved murder, perhaps relayed by a supernatural force. Knowing just how crazy it all sounds, Mallory nevertheless sets out to decipher the images and save Teddy before it’s too late.","tags":["Horror","Thriller","Mystery","Fiction","Mystery Thriller","Book Club","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.15,"genres":["thriller"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1635260162i/58724923.jpg","publishYear":2022,"numPages":372,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58724923-hidden-pictures"},{"id":"223","title":"The Inmate (Kindle Edition)","author":"Freida McFadden","description":"There are three rules Brooke Sullivan must follow as a new nurse practitioner at a men's maximum-security: 1) Treat all prisoners with respect. 2) Never reveal any personal information. 3) Never EVER ","fullDescription":"There are three rules Brooke Sullivan must follow as a new nurse practitioner at a men's maximum-security: 1) Treat all prisoners with respect. 2) Never reveal any personal information. 3) Never EVER become too friendly with the inmates.

But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family. What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder. Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant. It was everything. She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is. Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, The Turn of the Key is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.","tags":["Thriller","Mystery","Mystery Thriller","Fiction","Audiobook","Horror","Suspense","...more"],"rating":3.91,"genres":["thriller"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548204800i/42080142.jpg","publishYear":2019,"numPages":337,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42080142-the-turn-of-the-key"},{"id":"225","title":"Misery (Paperback)","author":"Stephen        King","description":"Alternate Cover Editions #1 , #2 , #3 , #4 Paul Sheldon.

The Creeds are going to learn that sometimes dead is better.","tags":["Horror","Fiction","Thriller","Audiobook","Fantasy","Paranormal","Horror Thriller","...more"],"rating":4.08,"genres":["horror"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480069533i/33124137.jpg","publishYear":1983,"numPages":580,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33124137-pet-sematary"},{"id":"232","title":"’Salem’s Lot (Paperback)","author":"Stephen        King","description":"Librarian's Note: Alternate-cover edition for ISBN 0450031063 Thousands of miles away from the small township of 'Salem's Lot, two terrified people, a man and a boy, still share the secrets of those c","fullDescription":"Librarian's Note: Alternate-cover edition for ISBN 0450031063 Thousands of miles away from the small township of 'Salem's Lot, two terrified people, a man and a boy, still share the secrets of those clapboard houses and tree-lined streets.

She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the region. Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She’s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she’s also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin’s new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the house itself, which begins to invade Noemi’s dreams with visions of blood and doom. Her only ally in this inhospitable abode is the family’s youngest son. Shy and gentle, he seems to want to help Noemí, but might also be hiding dark knowledge of his family’s past. For there are many secrets behind the walls of High Place. The family’s once colossal wealth and faded mining empire kept them from prying eyes, but as Noemí digs deeper she unearths stories of violence and madness. And Noemí, mesmerized by the terrifying yet seductive world of High Place, may soon find it impossible to ever leave this enigmatic house behind.","tags":["Horror","Fiction","Historical Fiction","Gothic","Mystery","Fantasy","Thriller","...more"],"rating":3.67,"genres":["horror"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1607462569i/53152636.jpg","publishYear":2020,"numPages":320,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53152636-mexican-gothic"},{"id":"236","title":"House of Leaves (Paperback)","author":"Mark Z.

On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless – mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs.

Patricia Campbell had always planned for a big life, but after giving up her career as a nurse to marry an ambitious doctor and become a mother, Patricia's life has never felt smaller. The days are long, her kids are ungrateful, her husband is distant, and her to-do list is never really done. The one thing she has to look forward to is her book club, a group of Charleston mothers united only by their love for true-crime and suspenseful fiction. In these meetings, they're more likely to discuss the FBI's recent siege of Waco as much as the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood. But when an artistic and sensitive stranger moves into the neighborhood, the book club's meetings turn into speculation about the newcomer. Patricia is initially attracted to him, but when some local children go missing, she starts to suspect the newcomer is involved. She begins her own investigation, assuming that he's a Jeffrey Dahmer or Ted Bundy. What she uncovers is far more terrifying, and soon she--and her book club--are the only people standing between the monster they've invited into their homes and their unsuspecting community.","tags":["Horror","Fiction","Fantasy","Vampires","Audiobook","Book Club","Thriller","...more"],"rating":3.79,"genres":["horror"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1584222716i/44074800.jpg","publishYear":2020,"numPages":410,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44074800-the-southern-book-club-s-guide-to-slaying-vampires"},{"id":"242","title":"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War (Hardcover)","author":"Max Brooks","description":"The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years. Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \\"By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?\\" Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.","tags":["Horror","Fiction","Zombies","Science Fiction","Fantasy","Post Apocalyptic","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.02,"genres":["horror"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312647i/8908.jpg","publishYear":2006,"numPages":342,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8908.World_War_Z"},{"id":"243","title":"The Only Good Indians (Hardcover)","author":"Stephen Graham Jones","description":"The creeping horror of Paul Tremblay meets Tommy Orange’s There There in a dark novel of revenge, cultural identity, and the cost of breaking from tradition in this latest novel from the Jordan Peele ","fullDescription":"The creeping horror of Paul Tremblay meets Tommy Orange’s There There in a dark novel of revenge, cultural identity, and the cost of breaking from tradition in this latest novel from the Jordan Peele of horror literature, Stephen Graham Jones.

The boys are a tight-knit crew. There’s Kent, one of the most popular kids in school; Ephraim and Max, also well-liked and easygoing; then there’s Newt the nerd and Shelley the odd duck. For the most part, they all get along and are happy to be there – which makes Scoutmaster Tim’s job a little easier. But for some reason, he can’t shake the feeling that something strange is in the air this year. Something wicked . . . It comes to them in the night. An unexpected intruder, stumbling upon their campsite like a wild animal. He is shockingly thin, disturbingly pale, and voraciously hungry – a man in unspeakable torment who exposes Tim and the boys to something far more frightening than any ghost story.

At a time when the King brand has never been stronger, he has delivered one of his most unsettling and compulsively readable stories. An eleven-year-old boy’s violated corpse is found in a town park. Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City’s most popular citizens. He is Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney soon add DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad. As the investigation expands and horrifying answers begin to emerge, King’s propulsive story kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense. Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy, but is he wearing another face? When the answer comes, it will shock you as only Stephen King can.","tags":["Horror","Fiction","Thriller","Mystery","Audiobook","Crime","Mystery Thriller","...more"],"rating":4.01,"genres":["horror"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524596540i/36124936.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":561,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36124936-the-outsider"},{"id":"255","title":"Carmilla (Paperback)","author":"J.

To her parents' despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie's descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts' plight. With John, Marjorie's father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend. Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie's younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface--and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.","tags":["Horror","Fiction","Thriller","Mystery","Audiobook","Paranormal","Adult","...more"],"rating":3.78,"genres":["horror"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415678368i/23019294.jpg","publishYear":2015,"numPages":287,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23019294-a-head-full-of-ghosts"},{"id":"259","title":"Bunny (Bunny, #1)","author":"Mona Awad","description":"We were just these innocent girls in the night trying to make something beautiful.

We very nearly did, didn't we? Samantha Heather Mackey couldn't be more of an outsider in her small, highly selective MFA program at New England's Warren University. A scholarship student who prefers the company of her dark imagination to that of most people, she is utterly repelled by the rest of her fiction writing cohort--a clique of unbearably twee rich girls who call each other Bunny, and seem to move and speak as one. But everything changes when Samantha receives an invitation to the Bunnies' fabled Smut Salon, and finds herself inexplicably drawn to their front door--ditching her only friend, Ava, in the process. As Samantha plunges deeper and deeper into the Bunnies' sinister yet saccharine world, beginning to take part in the ritualistic off-campus Workshop where they conjure their monstrous creations, the edges of reality begin to blur. Soon, her friendships with Ava and the Bunnies will be brought into deadly collision. The spellbinding new novel from one of our most fearless chroniclers of the female experience, Bunny is a down-the-rabbit-hole tale of loneliness and belonging, friendship and desire, and the fantastic and terrible power of the imagination.

The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.” In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute. As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King's gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good versus evil in a world where the good guys don't always win. --front flap","tags":["Horror","Fiction","Thriller","Science Fiction","Audiobook","Fantasy","Mystery","...more"],"rating":4.2,"genres":["horror"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549241208i/43798285.jpg","publishYear":2019,"numPages":561,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43798285-the-institute"},{"id":"272","title":"Cell (Mass Market Paperback)","author":"Stephen        King","description":"Where were you on October 1st at 3:03 pm?

Alone and rudderless in New York, he is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. He is tormented by an unbearable longing for his mother, and down the years clings to the thing that most reminds him of her: a small, strangely captivating painting that ultimately draws him into the criminal underworld. As he grows up, Theo learns to glide between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love - and his talisman, the painting, places him at the centre of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle. The Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through present-day America and a drama of enthralling power. Combining unforgettably vivid characters and thrilling suspense, it is a beautiful, addictive triumph - a sweeping story of loss and obsession, of survival and self-invention, of the deepest mysteries of love, identity and fate.","tags":["Fiction","Book Club","Contemporary","Literary Fiction","Audiobook","Dark Academia","Mystery","...more"],"rating":3.96,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1378710146i/17333223.jpg","publishYear":2013,"numPages":771,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch"},{"id":"275","title":"Normal People (Hardcover)","author":"Sally Rooney","description":"At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other.

He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers - one they are determined to conceal. A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other. Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.","tags":["Fiction","Romance","Contemporary","Literary Fiction","Audiobook","Book Club","Ireland","...more"],"rating":3.81,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1571423190i/41057294.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":273,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41057294-normal-people"},{"id":"276","title":"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow (Hardcover)","author":"Gabrielle Zevin","description":"In this exhilarating novel, two friends—often in love, but never lovers—come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, a","fullDescription":"In this exhilarating novel, two friends—often in love, but never lovers—come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality. On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo . Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love.

Kathy had long ago put this idyllic past behind her, but when two of her Hailsham friends come back into her life, she stops resisting the pull of memory. And so, as her friendship with Ruth is rekindled, and as the feelings that long ago fueled her adolescent crush on Tommy begin to deepen into love, Kathy recalls their years at Hailsham. She describes happy scenes of boys and girls growing up together, unperturbed – even comforted – by their isolation. But she describes other scenes as well: of discord and misunderstanding that hint at a dark secret behind Hailsham's nurturing facade. With the dawning clarity of hindsight, the three friends are compelled to face the truth about their childhood – and about their lives now.","tags":["Fiction","Science Fiction","Dystopia","Book Club","Contemporary","Literary Fiction","Romance","...more"],"rating":3.85,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353048590i/6334.jpg","publishYear":2005,"numPages":288,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6334.Never_Let_Me_Go"},{"id":"278","title":"A Little Life (Hardcover)","author":"Hanya Yanagihara","description":"When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition.

Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.","tags":["Fiction","Contemporary","Literary Fiction","LGBT","Queer","Book Club","Mental Health","...more"],"rating":4.29,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446469353i/22822858.jpg","publishYear":2015,"numPages":720,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822858-a-little-life"},{"id":"279","title":"The Great Gatsby (Paperback)","author":"F.

Our narrator should be happy, shouldn’t she? She’s young, thin, pretty, a recent Columbia graduate, works an easy job at a hip art gallery, lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan paid for, like the rest of her needs, by her inheritance. But there is a dark and vacuous hole in her heart, and it isn’t just the loss of her parents, or the way her Wall Street boyfriend treats her, or her sadomasochistic relationship with her best friend, Reva. It’s the year 2000 in a city aglitter with wealth and possibility; what could be so terribly wrong? My Year of Rest and Relaxation is a powerful answer to that question. Through the story of a year spent under the influence of a truly mad combination of drugs designed to heal our heroine from her alienation from this world, Moshfegh shows us how reasonable, even necessary, alienation can be. Both tender and blackly funny, merciless and compassionate, it is a showcase for the gifts of one of our major writers working at the height of her powers.","tags":["Fiction","Contemporary","Literary Fiction","Audiobook","Mental Health","Book Club","Adult","...more"],"rating":3.61,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597676656i/44279110.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":289,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279110-my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation"},{"id":"281","title":"On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous (Hardcover)","author":"Ocean Vuong","description":"On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read.

Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard. With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.","tags":["Fiction","Poetry","LGBT","Contemporary","Queer","Literary Fiction","Book Club","...more"],"rating":4.02,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1615580168i/41880609.jpg","publishYear":2019,"numPages":246,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41880609-on-earth-we-re-briefly-gorgeous"},{"id":"282","title":"The Vanishing Half (Hardcover)","author":"Brit Bennett","description":"The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical.

But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect? Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins.","tags":["Fiction","Historical Fiction","Book Club","Audiobook","Contemporary","Literary Fiction","Historical","...more"],"rating":4.13,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577090827l/51791252.jpg","publishYear":2020,"numPages":343,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half"},{"id":"283","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird (Paperback)","author":"Harper Lee","description":"One of the best-loved stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormousl","fullDescription":"One of the best-loved stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country.

In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned – from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules. Enter Mia Warren – an enigmatic artist and single mother – who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother–daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community. When old family friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town – and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides.

Bright, ambitious, and yearning for adulthood, fifteen-year-old Vanessa Wye becomes entangled in an affair with Jacob Strane, her magnetic and guileful forty-two-year-old English teacher. 2017. Amid the rising wave of allegations against powerful men, a reckoning is coming due. Strane has been accused of sexual abuse by a former student, who reaches out to Vanessa, and now Vanessa suddenly finds herself facing an impossible choice: remain silent, firm in the belief that her teenage self willingly engaged in this relationship, or redefine herself and the events of her past. But how can Vanessa reject her first love, the man who fundamentally transformed her and has been a persistent presence in her life? Is it possible that the man she loved as a teenager—and who professed to worship only her—may be far different from what she has always believed? Alternating between Vanessa’s present and her past, My Dark Vanessa juxtaposes memory and trauma with the breathless excitement of a teenage girl discovering the power her own body can wield. Thought-provoking and impossible to put down, this is a masterful portrayal of troubled adolescence and its repercussions that raises vital questions about agency, consent, complicity, and victimhood.

Frances is twenty-one years old, cool-headed, and darkly observant. A college student and aspiring writer, she devotes herself to a life of the mind--and to the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi, her best friend and comrade-in-arms. Lovers at school, the two young women now perform spoken-word poetry together in Dublin, where a journalist named Melissa spots their potential. Drawn into Melissa's orbit, Frances is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and tall, handsome husband. Private property, Frances believes, is a cultural evil--and Nick, a bored actor who never quite lived up to his potential, looks like patriarchy made flesh. But however amusing their flirtation seems at first, it gives way to a strange intimacy neither of them expect. As Frances tries to keep her life in check, her relationships increasingly resist her control: with Nick, with her difficult and unhappy father, and finally even with Bobbi. Desperate to reconcile herself to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body, Frances's intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new: a painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment. Written with gem-like precision and probing intelligence, Conversations With Friends is wonderfully alive to the pleasures and dangers of youth.\\"","tags":["Fiction","Contemporary","Romance","Literary Fiction","Audiobook","LGBT","Book Club","...more"],"rating":3.74,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1638729263i/32187419.jpg","publishYear":2017,"numPages":304,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32187419-conversations-with-friends"},{"id":"289","title":"A Man Called Ove (Hardcover)","author":"Fredrik Backman","description":"Meet Ove.

He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him the bitter neighbor from hell , but must Ove be bitter just because he doesn't walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time? Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove's mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents' association to their very foundations.","tags":["Fiction","Book Club","Contemporary","Audiobook","Humor","Adult","Literary Fiction","...more"],"rating":4.38,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405259930i/18774964.jpg","publishYear":2012,"numPages":337,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove"},{"id":"290","title":"The Catcher in the Rye (Paperback)","author":"J.D.

Fleeing the crooks at Pencey Prep, he pinballs around New York City seeking solace in fleeting encounters—shooting the bull with strangers in dive hotels, wandering alone round Central Park, getting beaten up by pimps and cut down by erstwhile girlfriends. The city is beautiful and terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the only person who really understands him, and his determination to escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning. The Catcher in the Rye is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood behind. J.D. Salinger's (1919–2010) classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time 's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Young Adult","Literature","School","Coming Of Age","Novels","...more"],"rating":3.8,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398034300i/5107.jpg","publishYear":1951,"numPages":277,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye"},{"id":"291","title":"Convenience Store Woman (Hardcover)","author":"Sayaka Murata","description":"The English-language debut of one of Japan's most talented contemporary writers, selling over 650,000 copies there, Convenience Store Woman is the heartwarming and surprising story of thirty-six-year-","fullDescription":"The English-language debut of one of Japan's most talented contemporary writers, selling over 650,000 copies there, Convenience Store Woman is the heartwarming and surprising story of thirty-six-year-old Tokyo resident Keiko Furukura. Keiko has never fit in, neither in her family, nor in school, but when at the age of eighteen she begins working at the Hiiromachi branch of “Smile Mart,” she finds peace and purpose in her life. In the store, unlike anywhere else, she understands the rules of social interaction―many are laid out line by line in the store’s manual―and she does her best to copy the dress, mannerisms, and speech of her colleagues, playing the part of a “normal” person excellently, more or less. Keiko is very happy, but the people close to her, from her family to her coworkers, increasingly pressure her to find a husband, and to start a proper career, prompting her to take desperate action… A brilliant depiction of a world hidden from view, Convenience Store Woman is an ironic and sharp-eyed look at contemporary work culture and the pressures we all feel to conform, as well as a charming and completely fresh portrait of an unforgettable heroine.","tags":["Fiction","Contemporary","Japan","Japanese Literature","Audiobook","Literary Fiction","Book Club","...more"],"rating":3.68,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1680105376i/36739755.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":163,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36739755-convenience-store-woman"},{"id":"292","title":"The Vegetarian (Hardcover)","author":"Han Kang","description":"Before the nightmares began, Yeong-hye and her husband lived an ordinary, controlled life.

But the dreams—invasive images of blood and brutality—torture her, driving Yeong-hye to purge her mind and renounce eating meat altogether. It’s a small act of independence, but it interrupts her marriage and sets into motion an increasingly grotesque chain of events at home. As her husband, her brother-in-law and sister each fight to reassert their control, Yeong-hye obsessively defends the choice that’s become sacred to her. Soon their attempts turn desperate, subjecting first her mind, and then her body, to ever more intrusive and perverse violations, sending Yeong-hye spiraling into a dangerous, bizarre estrangement, not only from those closest to her, but also from herself. Celebrated by critics around the world, The Vegetarian is a darkly allegorical, Kafka-esque tale of power, obsession, and one woman’s struggle to break free from the violence both without and within her.","tags":["Fiction","Horror","Contemporary","Literary Fiction","Book Club","Asia","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":3.65,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1728661771i/25489025.jpg","publishYear":2007,"numPages":188,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489025-the-vegetarian"},{"id":"293","title":"Small Things Like These (Hardcover)","author":"Claire Keegan","description":"It is 1985 in a small Irish town.

In a plot that never pauses for breath, relayed in his own unsparing voice, he braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities. Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield from his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. Dickens is not a prerequisite for readers of this novel, but he provided its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens' anger and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of a good story. Demon Copperhead speaks for a new generation of lost boys, and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can't imagine leaving behind.","tags":["Fiction","Book Club","Historical Fiction","Audiobook","Literary Fiction","Contemporary","Coming Of Age","...more"],"rating":4.47,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1660050779i/60194162.jpg","publishYear":2022,"numPages":560,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60194162-demon-copperhead"},{"id":"295","title":"All the Light We Cannot See (Hardcover)","author":"Anthony Doerr","description":"Marie-Laure lives in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where her father works.

In a mining town in Germany, Werner Pfennig, an orphan, grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find that brings them news and stories from places they have never seen or imagined.

Lydia is the favourite child of Marilyn and James Lee; a girl who inherited her mother's bright blue eyes and her father's jet-black hair. Her parents are determined that Lydia will fulfill the dreams they were unable to pursue - in Marilyn's case that her daughter become a doctor rather than a homemaker, in James's case that Lydia be popular at school, a girl with a busy social life and the centre of every party. But Lydia is under pressures that have nothing to do with growing up in 1970s small town Ohio. Her father is an American born of first-generation Chinese immigrants, and his ethnicity, and hers, make them conspicuous in any setting. When Lydia's body is found in the local lake, James is consumed by guilt and sets out on a reckless path that may destroy his marriage. Marilyn, devastated and vengeful, is determined to make someone accountable, no matter what the cost. Lydia's older brother, Nathan, is convinced that local bad boy Jack is somehow involved. But it's the youngest in the family - Hannah - who observes far more than anyone realises and who may be the only one who knows what really happened. Everything I Never Told You is a gripping page-turner, about secrets, love, longing, lies and race.

Kirsten Raymonde will never forget the night Arthur Leander, the famous Hollywood actor, had a heart attack on stage during a production of King Lear. That was the night when a devastating flu pandemic arrived in the city, and within weeks, civilization as we know it came to an end. Twenty years later, Kirsten moves between the settlements of the altered world with a small troupe of actors and musicians. They call themselves The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated themselves to keeping the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten the tiny band’s existence. And as the story takes off, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, the strange twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed.","tags":["Fiction","Science Fiction","Dystopia","Book Club","Post Apocalyptic","Audiobook","Fantasy","...more"],"rating":4.07,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1680459872i/20170404.jpg","publishYear":2014,"numPages":333,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20170404-station-eleven"},{"id":"300","title":"My Brilliant Friend (Neapolitan Novels, #1)","author":"Elena Ferrante","description":"Beginning in the 1950s in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples, Elena Ferrante's four-volume story spans almost sixty years, as its main characters, the fiery and unforgettable L","fullDescription":"Beginning in the 1950s in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples, Elena Ferrante's four-volume story spans almost sixty years, as its main characters, the fiery and unforgettable Lila and the bookish narrator, Elena, become women, wives, mothers, and leaders, all the while maintaining a complex and at times conflicted friendship.

The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can't fix up their own marriage. There's a wealthy banker who has been too busy making money to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can't seem to agree on anything, from where they want to live to how they met in the first place. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment's only bathroom, and you've got the worst group of hostages in the world. Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in a motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.

He promises her the world, but when she discovers she is pregnant—and that her lover is married—she refuses to be bought. Instead, she accepts an offer of marriage from a gentle, sickly minister passing through on his way to Japan. But her decision to abandon her home, and to reject her son's powerful father, sets off a dramatic saga that will echo down through the generations. Richly told and profoundly moving, Pachinko is a story of love, sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty. From bustling street markets to the halls of Japan's finest universities to the pachinko parlors of the criminal underworld, Lee's complex and passionate characters—strong, stubborn women, devoted sisters and sons, fathers shaken by moral crisis—survive and thrive against the indifferent arc of history.","tags":["Historical Fiction","Fiction","Book Club","Historical","Japan","Audiobook","Asia","...more"],"rating":4.34,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529845599i/34051011.jpg","publishYear":2017,"numPages":496,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34051011-pachinko"},{"id":"306","title":"Americanah (Hardcover)","author":"Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie","description":"Ifemelu and Obinze are young and in love when they depart military-ruled Nigeria for the West.

While picking cherries, they beg their mother to tell them the story of Peter Duke, a famous actor with whom she shared both a stage and a romance years before at a theater company called Tom Lake. As Lara recalls the past, her daughters examine their own lives and relationship with their mother, and are forced to reconsider the world and everything they thought they knew. Tom Lake is a meditation on youthful love, married love, and the lives parents have led before their children were born. Both hopeful and elegiac, it explores what it means to be happy even when the world is falling apart. As in all of her novels, Ann Patchett combines compelling narrative artistry with piercing insights into family dynamics. The result is a rich and luminous story, told with profound intelligence and emotional subtlety, that demonstrates once again why she is one of the most revered and acclaimed literary talents working today.","tags":["Fiction","Audiobook","Book Club","Literary Fiction","Romance","Historical Fiction","Contemporary","...more"],"rating":3.94,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1691084837i/63241104.jpg","publishYear":2023,"numPages":320,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63241104-tom-lake"},{"id":"309","title":"Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine (Paperback)","author":"Gail Honeyman","description":"No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine.

Meet Eleanor Oliphant: She struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding social interactions, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen on the sidewalk, the three become the kinds of friends who rescue one another from the lives of isolation they have each been living. And it is Raymond’s big heart that will ultimately help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. Soon to be a major motion picture produced by Reese Witherspoon, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the smart, warm, and uplifting story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . .

People say Beartown is finished. A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded this town. And in that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semi-finals, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the hopes and dreams of this place now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys. Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden, and the semi-final match is the catalyst for a violent act that will leave a young girl traumatized and a town in turmoil. Accusations are made and, like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected. Beartown explores the hopes that bring a small community together, the secrets that tear it apart, and the courage it takes for an individual to go against the grain. In this story of a small forest town, Fredrik Backman has found the entire world.","tags":["Fiction","Contemporary","Book Club","Audiobook","Sports","Literary Fiction","Adult","...more"],"rating":4.29,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1482108618i/33413128.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":432,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33413128-beartown"},{"id":"311","title":"Beloved (Beloved Trilogy, #1)","author":"Toni Morrison","description":"Staring unflinchingly into the abyss of slavery, this spellbinding novel transforms history into a story as powerful as Exodus and as intimate as a lullaby.

A primeira compra que faz é uma opulenta propriedade nos subúrbios de Filadélfia, nos EUA, antes pertencente a uma família neerlandesa, entretanto arruinada. Conroy muda-se, com a mulher, Elna, e a filha, a confiante e protetora Maeve, para a nova casa, na qual já nascerá Danny, o narrador desta história. O que seria uma agradável mudança de vida, torna-se no desmoronamento de toda a família, numa espécie de paraíso perdido. Elna, incapaz de lidar com as mordomias da propriedade e respetivos empregados, termina o casamento e foge, deixando também os filhos. Mais tarde, chega à propriedade uma madrasta, Andrea, uma jovem viúva com duas filhas, e os dois irmãos, Maeve e Danny, vão sendo afastados aos poucos, até que acabam expulsos da própria casa, devolvidos à pobreza, podendo contar apenas um com o outro para lidar com a perda, com a humilhação, com a raiva, até que um dia possam, enfim, confrontar quem os abandonou.

A novel of breathtaking sweep and emotional power that traces three hundred years in Ghana and along the way also becomes a truly great American novel. Extraordinary for its exquisite language, its implacable sorrow, its soaring beauty, and for its monumental portrait of the forces that shape families and nations, Homegoing heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction. Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of Homegoing follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, Homegoing makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation. Generation after generation, Yaa Gyasi's magisterial first novel sets the fate of the individual against the obliterating movements of time, delivering unforgettable characters whose lives were shaped by historical forces beyond their control. Homegoing is a tremendous reading experience, not to be missed, by an astonishingly gifted young writer.","tags":["Historical Fiction","Fiction","Book Club","Africa","Historical","Literary Fiction","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.47,"genres":["literary fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448108591i/27071490.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":305,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27071490-homegoing"},{"id":"314","title":"The Stranger (Paperback)","author":"Albert Camus","description":"Published in 1942 by French author Albert Camus, The Stranger has long been considered a classic of twentieth-century literature.

France, 1939 In the quiet village of Carriveau, Vianne Mauriac says goodbye to her husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front. She doesn't believe that the Nazis will invade France…but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne's home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive. Vianne's sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets Gäetan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can…completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others. With courage, grace, and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of World War II and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women's war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France―a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women.

Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone. Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken. Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own. Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed. In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life. The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.

Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she's never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb... As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.

When twenty-year-old nursing student Frances “Frankie” McGrath hears these words, it is a revelation. Raised in the sun-drenched, idyllic world of Southern California and sheltered by her conservative parents, she has always prided herself on doing the right thing. But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path. As green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is over- whelmed by the chaos and destruction of war. Each day is a gamble of life and death, hope and betrayal; friendships run deep and can be shattered in an instant. In war, she meets—and becomes one of—the lucky, the brave, the broken, and the lost. But war is just the beginning for Frankie and her veteran friends. The real battle lies in coming home to a changed and divided America, to angry protesters, and to a country that wants to forget Vietnam. The Women is the story of one woman gone to war, but it shines a light on all women who put themselves in harm’s way and whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has too often been forgotten. A novel about deep friendships and bold patriotism, The Women is a richly drawn story with a memorable heroine whose idealism and courage under fire will come to define an era.","tags":["Historical Fiction","Book Club","Fiction","Audiobook","Historical","War","Adult","...more"],"rating":4.6,"genres":["historical fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1733493019i/127305853.jpg","publishYear":2024,"numPages":471,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127305853-the-women"},{"id":"326","title":"The Alice Network (Paperback)","author":"Kate Quinn","description":"In an enthralling new historical novel from national bestselling author Kate Quinn, two women—a female spy recruited to the real-life Alice Network in France during World War I and an unconventional A","fullDescription":"In an enthralling new historical novel from national bestselling author Kate Quinn, two women—a female spy recruited to the real-life Alice Network in France during World War I and an unconventional American socialite searching for her cousin in 1947—are brought together in a mesmerizing story of courage and redemption. 1947.

When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a Tätowierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners. Imprisoned for more than two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive. One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her. A vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.","tags":["Historical Fiction","Fiction","Historical","Book Club","Audiobook","World War II","Romance","...more"],"rating":4.32,"genres":["historical fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525962117i/38359036.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":272,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38359036-the-tattooist-of-auschwitz"},{"id":"330","title":"Salt to the Sea (Hardcover)","author":"Ruta Sepetys","description":"While the Titanic and Lusitania are both well-documented disasters, the single greatest tragedy in maritime history is the little-known January 30, 1945 sinking in the Baltic Sea by a Soviet submarine","fullDescription":"While the Titanic and Lusitania are both well-documented disasters, the single greatest tragedy in maritime history is the little-known January 30, 1945 sinking in the Baltic Sea by a Soviet submarine of the Wilhelm Gustloff, a German cruise liner that was supposed to ferry wartime personnel and refugees to safety from the advancing Red Army. The ship was overcrowded with more than 10,500 passengers — the intended capacity was approximately 1,800 — and more than 9,000 people, including 5,000 children, lost their lives.

Joana, a Lithuanian with nursing experience; Florian, a Prussian soldier fleeing the Nazis with stolen treasure; and Emilia, a Polish girl close to the end of her pregnancy, converge on their escape journeys as Russian troops advance; each will eventually meet Albert, a Nazi peon with delusions of grandeur, assigned to the Gustloff decks.","tags":["Historical Fiction","Young Adult","Fiction","Historical","World War II","War","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.35,"genres":["historical fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437084512i/25614492.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":391,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25614492-salt-to-the-sea"},{"id":"331","title":"Between Shades of Gray (Hardcover)","author":"Ruta Sepetys","description":"Lina is just like any other fifteen-year-old Lithuanian girl in 1941.

Separated from her father, forced onto a crowded and dirty train car, Lina, her mother, and her young brother slowly make their way north, crossing the Arctic Circle, to a work camp in the coldest reaches of Siberia. Here they are forced, under Stalin's orders, to dig for beets and fight for their lives under the cruelest of conditions. Lina finds solace in her art, meticulously—and at great risk—documenting events by drawing, hoping these messages will make their way to her father's prison camp to let him know they are still alive.

Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood--where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned--Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted. In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor--engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom. Like the protagonist of Gulliver's Travels, Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey--hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.","tags":["Historical Fiction","Fiction","Book Club","Historical","Audiobook","Literary Fiction","Race","...more"],"rating":4.06,"genres":["historical fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493178362i/30555488.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":306,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30555488-the-underground-railroad"},{"id":"335","title":"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (Hardcover)","author":"John Boyne","description":"If you start to read this book, you will go on a journey with a nine-year-old boy named Bruno.

The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries—and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title. Girl with a Pearl Earring centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant—and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.","tags":["Historical Fiction","Fiction","Classics","Historical","Art","Romance","Book Club","...more"],"rating":3.93,"genres":["historical fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327197580i/2865.jpg","publishYear":1999,"numPages":233,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring"},{"id":"337","title":"Water for Elephants (Paperback)","author":"Sara Gruen","description":"When Jacob Jankowski, recently orphaned and suddenly adrift, jumps onto a passing train, he enters a world of freaks, drifters, and misfits, a second-rate circus struggling to survive during the Great","fullDescription":"When Jacob Jankowski, recently orphaned and suddenly adrift, jumps onto a passing train, he enters a world of freaks, drifters, and misfits, a second-rate circus struggling to survive during the Great Depression, making one-night stands in town after endless town.

But when Avery returns home to help her father weather a health crisis, a chance encounter leaves her with uncomfortable questions and compels her to take a journey through her family’s long-hidden history, on a path that will ultimately lead either to devastation or to redemption. Based on one of America’s most notorious real-life scandals—in which Georgia Tann, director of a Memphis-based adoption organization, kidnapped and sold poor children to wealthy families all over the country—Lisa Wingate’s riveting, wrenching, and ultimately uplifting tale reminds us how, even though the paths we take can lead to many places, the heart never forgets where we belong.","tags":["Historical Fiction","Book Club","Fiction","Audiobook","Historical","Adult","Adult Fiction","...more"],"rating":4.4,"genres":["historical fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498910914i/32148570.jpg","publishYear":2017,"numPages":342,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32148570-before-we-were-yours"},{"id":"342","title":"Code Name Verity (Code Name Verity, #1)","author":"Elizabeth Wein","description":"Oct. 11th, 1943 - A British spy plane crashes in Nazi-occupied France.

In fact, Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman. But it’s the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans; the lonely, brilliant, Nobel–prize nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with—of all things—her mind. True chemistry results. But like science, life is unpredictable. Which is why a few years later Elizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother, but the reluctant star of America’s most beloved cooking show Supper at Six . Elizabeth’s unusual approach to cooking (“combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride”) proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn’t just teaching women to cook. She’s daring them to change the status quo.

But Circe is a strange child--neither powerful like her father nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power: the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts, and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from or with the mortals she has come to love.","tags":["Fantasy","Mythology","Fiction","Historical Fiction","Greek Mythology","Book Club","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.22,"genres":["historical fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565909496i/35959740.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":393,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740-circe"},{"id":"347","title":"The Rose Code (Paperback)","author":"Kate Quinn","description":"The New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of The Huntress and The Alice Network returns with another heart-stopping World War II story of three female code breakers at Bletchley Park and the","fullDescription":"The New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of The Huntress and The Alice Network returns with another heart-stopping World War II story of three female code breakers at Bletchley Park and the spy they must root out after the war is over. 1940. As England prepares to fight the Nazis, three very different women answer the call to mysterious country estate Bletchley Park, where the best minds in Britain train to break German military codes. Vivacious debutante Osla is the girl who has everything—beauty, wealth, and the dashing Prince Philip of Greece sending her roses—but she burns to prove herself as more than a society girl, and puts her fluent German to use as a translator of decoded enemy secrets. Imperious self-made Mab, product of East-End London poverty, works the legendary code-breaking machines as she conceals old wounds and looks for a socially advantageous husband. Both Osla and Mab are quick to see the potential in local village spinster Beth, whose shyness conceals a brilliant facility with puzzles, and soon Beth spreads her wings as one of the Park’s few female cryptanalysts.

On the eve of a fateful war, New York socialite Caroline Ferriday has her hands full with her post at the French consulate and a new love on the horizon. But Caroline’s world is forever changed when Hitler’s army invades Poland in September 1939—and then sets its sights on France. An ocean away from Caroline, Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish teenager, senses her carefree youth disappearing as she sinks deeper into her role as courier for the underground resistance movement. In a tense atmosphere of watchful eyes and suspect neighbors, one false move can have dire consequences. For ambitious young German doctor, Herta Oberheuser, an ad for a government medical position seems her ticket out of a desolate life. But, once hired, she finds herself trapped in a male-dominated realm of Nazi secrets and power. The lives of these three women are set on a collision course when the unthinkable happens and Kasia is sent to Ravensbrück, the notorious female-only Nazi concentration camp.

Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America’s last true frontier. Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time, caught in the riptide of her parents’ passionate, stormy relationship, dares to hope that a new land will lead to a better future for her family. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means following him into the unknown. At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild, remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community of strong men and even stronger women. The long, sunlit days and the generosity of the locals make up for the Allbrights’ lack of preparation and dwindling resources. But as winter approaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt’s fragile mental state deteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own.

Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent. Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home. Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.","tags":["Nonfiction","Memoir","Book Club","Biography","Audiobook","Biography Memoir","Autobiography","...more"],"rating":4.47,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506026635i/35133922.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":352,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated"},{"id":"358","title":"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking (Hardcover)","author":"Susan Cain","description":"The book that started the Quiet Revolution At least one-third of the people we know are introverts.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves. Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader’s guide and bonus content.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Self Help","Audiobook","Science","Personal Development","Business","...more"],"rating":4.08,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328562861i/8520610.jpg","publishYear":2012,"numPages":333,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet"},{"id":"359","title":"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Paperback)","author":"Yuval Noah Harari","description":"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and en","fullDescription":"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.","tags":["Nonfiction","History","Science","Audiobook","Philosophy","Anthropology","Psychology","...more"],"rating":4.34,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1703329310i/23692271.jpg","publishYear":2011,"numPages":512,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens"},{"id":"360","title":"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Hardcover)","author":"Steven D.

Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world. These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics. Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan. What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter. Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.

As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.","tags":["Nonfiction","Memoir","Biography","Audiobook","Book Club","Autobiography","Politics","...more"],"rating":4.44,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528206996i/38746485.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":448,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746485-becoming"},{"id":"363","title":"I’m Glad My Mom Died (Hardcover)","author":"Jennette McCurdy","description":"A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam & Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship wit","fullDescription":"A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam & Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life. Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income. In I’m Glad My Mom Died , Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly , she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants. Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.","tags":["Nonfiction","Memoir","Audiobook","Biography","Autobiography","Mental Health","Book Club","...more"],"rating":4.44,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1649228846i/59366244.jpg","publishYear":2022,"numPages":304,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59366244-i-m-glad-my-mom-died"},{"id":"364","title":"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America (Hardcover)","author":"Erik Larson","description":"Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that 'The Devil","fullDescription":"Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that 'The Devil in the White City' is not, in fact, a highly imaginative novel. Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous \\"White City\\" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe","tags":["Nonfiction","History","True Crime","Book Club","Crime","Historical","Mystery","...more"],"rating":4,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1583433024i/397483.jpg","publishYear":2003,"numPages":464,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397483.The_Devil_in_the_White_City"},{"id":"365","title":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life (Paperback)","author":"Mark Manson","description":"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738 In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be \\"positive\\" all the time so that","fullDescription":"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738 In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be \\"positive\\" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \\"F**k positivity,\\" Mark Manson says. \\"Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—\\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.","tags":["Nonfiction","Self Help","Psychology","Audiobook","Personal Development","Philosophy","Business","...more"],"rating":3.87,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465761302i/28257707.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":212,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck"},{"id":"366","title":"Man's Search for Meaning (Paperback)","author":"Viktor E.

Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful.

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her enslaved ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — a land of wooden quarters for enslaved people, faith healings, and voodoo — to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.","tags":["Nonfiction","Science","Book Club","History","Biography","Audiobook","Medicine","...more"],"rating":4.13,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327878144i/6493208.jpg","publishYear":2010,"numPages":370,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks"},{"id":"370","title":"Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood (Hardcover)","author":"Trevor Noah","description":"The memoir of one man’s coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed.

Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.","tags":["Nonfiction","Memoir","Biography","Audiobook","Book Club","Humor","Autobiography","...more"],"rating":4.49,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473867911i/29780253.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":289,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime"},{"id":"371","title":"Into the Wild (Kindle Edition)","author":"Jon Krakauer","description":"Krakauer’s page-turning bestseller explores a famed missing person mystery while unraveling the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of ","fullDescription":"Krakauer’s page-turning bestseller explores a famed missing person mystery while unraveling the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons. \\"Terrifying... Eloquent... A heart-rending drama of human yearning.\\" —New York Times In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter. How Christopher Johnson McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild. Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild. Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life. Admitting an interst that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the drives and desires that propelled McCandless. When McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naiveté, pretensions, and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity, and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality. Mesmerizing, heartbreaking, Into the Wild is a tour de force.

Night is the terrifying record of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man. This new translation by his wife and most frequent translator, Marion Wiesel, corrects important details and presents the most accurate rendering in English of Elie Wiesel's testimony to what happened in the camps and of his unforgettable message that this horror must simply never be allowed to happen again.","tags":["Nonfiction","Classics","History","Memoir","School","Holocaust","Biography","...more"],"rating":4.38,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1709507006i/1617.jpg","publishYear":1956,"numPages":120,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1617.Night"},{"id":"373","title":"When Breath Becomes Air (Kindle Edition)","author":"Paul Kalanithi","description":"For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the","fullDescription":"For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?' At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student \\"possessed,\\" as he wrote, \\"by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life\\" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. \\"I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,\\" he wrote. \\"Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'\\" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.","tags":["Nonfiction","Memoir","Biography","Medicine","Book Club","Audiobook","Medical","...more"],"rating":4.41,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492677644i/25899336.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":208,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air"},{"id":"374","title":"Thinking, Fast and Slow (Hardcover)","author":"Daniel Kahneman","description":"In the highly anticipated Thinking, Fast and Slow , Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think.

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Self Help","Science","Business","Economics","Personal Development","...more"],"rating":4.17,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317793965i/11468377.jpg","publishYear":2011,"numPages":499,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow"},{"id":"375","title":"In Cold Blood (Paperback)","author":"Truman Capote","description":"On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces.

Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden? Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.","tags":["Nonfiction","Memoir","Race","Audiobook","History","Social Justice","Book Club","...more"],"rating":4.4,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451435027i/25489625.jpg","publishYear":2015,"numPages":152,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me"},{"id":"378","title":"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking (Paperback)","author":"Malcolm Gladwell","description":"Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make.

Never again will you think about thinking the same way. Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \\"blink\\": the election of Warren Harding; \\"New Coke\\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \\"thin-slicing\\" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Business","Self Help","Science","Audiobook","Sociology","...more"],"rating":3.96,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440763417i/40102.jpg","publishYear":2005,"numPages":296,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink"},{"id":"379","title":"The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (Paperback)","author":"Malcolm Gladwell","description":"From the bestselling author of The Bomber Mafia: discover Malcolm Gladwell's breakthrough debut and explore the science behind viral trends in business, marketing, and human behavior.

After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe. Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And this was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case, and the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including a Native American agent who infiltrated the region, and together with the Osage began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.","tags":["Nonfiction","History","True Crime","Book Club","Audiobook","Crime","Mystery","...more"],"rating":4.14,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1696884539i/193388249.jpg","publishYear":2017,"numPages":338,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193388249-killers-of-the-flower-moon"},{"id":"381","title":"Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men (Hardcover)","author":"Caroline Criado Pérez","description":"Data is fundamental to the modern world.

From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives. Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates the shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women​ , diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more.

Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning, he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were desperately struggling for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated. Into Thin Air is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed journalist and author of the bestseller Into the Wild. On assignment for Outside Magazine to report on the growing commercialization of the mountain, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas as a client of Rob Hall, the most respected high-altitude guide in the world. A rangy, thirty-five-year-old New Zealander, Hall had summited Everest four times between 1990 and 1995 and had led thirty-nine climbers to the top. Ascending the mountain in close proximity to Hall's team was a guided expedition led by Scott Fischer, a forty-year-old American with legendary strength and drive who had climbed the peak without supplemental oxygen in 1994. But neither Hall nor Fischer survived the rogue storm that struck in May 1996. Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.","tags":["Nonfiction","Adventure","Memoir","Travel","Biography","History","Survival","...more"],"rating":4.26,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631501298i/1898.jpg","publishYear":1997,"numPages":368,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1898.Into_Thin_Air"},{"id":"383","title":"Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers (Paperback)","author":"Mary Roach","description":"Beloved, best-selling science writer Mary Roach’s classic, now with a new epilogue.

Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War. The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.","tags":["Nonfiction","History","Biography","Book Club","World War II","War","Historical","...more"],"rating":4.39,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327861115i/8664353.jpg","publishYear":2010,"numPages":475,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8664353-unbroken"},{"id":"388","title":"A Brief History of Time (Paperback)","author":"Stephen Hawking","description":"A landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawking’s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe begin—and what made its start possible?

Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again.

In the wake of her mother’s death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life. With no experience or training, driven only by blind will, she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State — and she would do it alone. Told with suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.","tags":["Nonfiction","Memoir","Book Club","Travel","Biography","Adventure","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.07,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453189881i/12262741.jpg","publishYear":2012,"numPages":336,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12262741-wild"},{"id":"391","title":"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business (Hardcover)","author":"Charles Duhigg","description":"In \\"The Power of Habit\\", award-winning \\"New York Times\\" business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be chan","fullDescription":"In \\"The Power of Habit\\", award-winning \\"New York Times\\" business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren's Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation's largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death. At its core, \\"The Power of Habit\\" contains an exhilarating the key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits aren't destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.","tags":["Nonfiction","Self Help","Psychology","Business","Personal Development","Productivity","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.13,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1545854312i/12609433.jpg","publishYear":2012,"numPages":375,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit"},{"id":"392","title":"I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer (ebook)","author":"Michelle McNamara","description":"A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died t","fullDescription":"A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case. \\"You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark.\\" For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area. Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called \\"the Golden State Killer.\\" Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was. At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening. I’ll Be Gone in the Dark —the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by Michelle’s lead researcher and a close colleague. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.","tags":["Nonfiction","True Crime","Audiobook","Crime","Mystery","Book Club","Memoir","...more"],"rating":4.12,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499131009i/35068432.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":352,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068432-i-ll-be-gone-in-the-dark"},{"id":"393","title":"I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban (Hardcover)","author":"Malala Yousafzai","description":"I come from a country that was created at midnight.

When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate. I Am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.","tags":["Nonfiction","Biography","Memoir","Feminism","Book Club","Autobiography","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.16,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375414895i/17851885.jpg","publishYear":2012,"numPages":327,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17851885-i-am-malala"},{"id":"394","title":"Crying in H Mart (Hardcover)","author":"Michelle Zauner","description":"The New York Times bestseller from the Grammy-nominated indie rockstar Japanese Breakfast, an unflinching, deeply moving memoir about growing up mixed-race, Korean food, losing her Korean mother, and ","fullDescription":"The New York Times bestseller from the Grammy-nominated indie rockstar Japanese Breakfast, an unflinching, deeply moving memoir about growing up mixed-race, Korean food, losing her Korean mother, and forging her own identity in the wake of her loss. In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humour and heart, she tells of growing up the only Asian-American kid at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother’s particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother’s tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the east coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, performing gigs with her fledgling band – and meeting the man who would become her husband – her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother’s diagnosis of terminal pancreatic cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her. Vivacious, lyrical and honest, Michelle Zauner’s voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage.

Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.","tags":["Nonfiction","History","Science","Philosophy","Audiobook","Anthropology","Sociology","...more"],"rating":4.19,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1468760805i/31138556.jpg","publishYear":2015,"numPages":450,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus"},{"id":"398","title":"A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail (Mass Market Paperback)","author":"Bill Bryson","description":"The Appalachian Trail stretches from Georgia to Maine and covers some of the most breathtaking terrain in America—majestic mountains, silent forests, sparking lakes.

Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world's foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score , he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers' capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments—from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga—that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain's natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk's own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to heal—and offers new hope for reclaiming lives.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Self Help","Mental Health","Health","Science","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.36,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1594559067i/18693771.jpg","publishYear":2014,"numPages":464,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score"},{"id":"403","title":"What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions (Hardcover)","author":"Randall Munroe","description":"Fans of the xkcd comic ask Munroe a lot of strange questions: What if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?

Vance's powerful origin story... From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate now serving as a U.S. Senator from Ohio and the Republican Vice Presidential candidate for the 2024 election, an incisive account of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town that offers a broader, probing look at the struggles of America's white working class. Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis—that of white working-class Americans. The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck. The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.'s grandparents were \\"dirt poor and in love,\\" and moved north from Kentucky's Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history. A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.","tags":["Nonfiction","Memoir","Biography","Book Club","Audiobook","Politics","Biography Memoir","...more"],"rating":3.84,"genres":["non-fiction"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463569814i/27161156.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":264,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy"},{"id":"405","title":"Little Women (Little Women, #1)","author":"Louisa May Alcott","description":"This is an alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780451529305.

While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with \\"woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the \\"girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Historical Fiction","Young Adult","Romance","Historical","Literature","...more"],"rating":4.17,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562690475i/1934.jpg","publishYear":1868,"numPages":449,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1934.Little_Women"},{"id":"406","title":"Sense and Sensibility (Paperback)","author":"Jane Austen","description":"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780141439662 'The more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.

Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her.

Yet they have formed a \\"family,\\" clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing Of Mice and Men , creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful. A unique perspective on life's hardships, this story has achieved the status of timeless classic due to its remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","School","Historical Fiction","Literature","Read For School","Novels","...more"],"rating":3.89,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511302904i/890.jpg","publishYear":1937,"numPages":107,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/890.Of_Mice_and_Men"},{"id":"408","title":"Lord of the Flies (Paperback)","author":"William Golding","description":"At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys.

At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Young Adult","School","Dystopia","Literature","Read For School","...more"],"rating":3.7,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327869409i/7624.jpg","publishYear":1954,"numPages":182,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies"},{"id":"409","title":"Romeo and Juliet (Mass Market Paperback)","author":"William Shakespeare","description":"THIS UPDATED EDITION INCLUDES: • Newly re-edited play text and revised commentary notes • Scene-by-scene plot summaries • A key to the play's famous lines and phrases • An introduction to reading Shak","fullDescription":"THIS UPDATED EDITION INCLUDES: • Newly re-edited play text and revised commentary notes • Scene-by-scene plot summaries • A key to the play's famous lines and phrases • An introduction to reading Shakespeare's language • An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play • Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library's vast holdings of rare books • An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading","tags":["Classics","Plays","Fiction","Romance","School","Shakespeare","Drama","...more"],"rating":3.74,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1640420894i/59926998.jpg","publishYear":1590,"numPages":301,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59926998-romeo-and-juliet"},{"id":"410","title":"Wuthering Heights (Paperback)","author":"Emily Brontë","description":"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here .

She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Romance","Historical Fiction","Audiobook","Historical","Literature","...more"],"rating":4.15,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385172413i/2156.jpg","publishYear":1817,"numPages":249,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion"},{"id":"414","title":"A Tale of Two Cities (Paperback)","author":"Charles Dickens","description":"A Tale of Two Cities is Charles Dickens’s great historical novel, set against the violent upheaval of the French Revolution.

So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the Odyssey . If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, then the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation. This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students. -- Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Poetry","Mythology","Fantasy","School","Literature","...more"],"rating":3.83,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1711957706i/1381.jpg","publishYear":0,"numPages":541,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1381.The_Odyssey"},{"id":"420","title":"The Scarlet Letter (Paperback)","author":"Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"Set in 17th-century Puritan Boston, Massachusetts, during the years 1642 to 1649, it tells the story of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and will not reveal her lover’s identi","fullDescription":"Set in 17th-century Puritan Boston, Massachusetts, during the years 1642 to 1649, it tells the story of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and will not reveal her lover’s identity.

While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art. Executed with high-spirited gusto, Northanger Abbey is a lighthearted, yet unsentimental commentary on love and marriage.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Romance","Gothic","Historical Fiction","Literature","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":3.85,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388201718i/50398.jpg","publishYear":1817,"numPages":260,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50398.Northanger_Abbey"},{"id":"429","title":"Anne of Green Gables (Anne of Green Gables, #1)","author":"L.M.

Anne Shirley, an eleven-year-old orphan, has arrived in this verdant corner of Prince Edward Island only to discover that the Cuthberts—elderly Matthew and his stern sister, Marilla—want to adopt a boy, not a feisty redheaded girl. But before they can send her back, Anne—who simply must have more scope for her imagination and a real home—wins them over completely. A much-loved classic that explores all the vulnerability, expectations, and dreams of a child growing up, Anne of Green Gables is also a wonderful portrait of a time, a place, a family… and, most of all, love.

It is not simply for himself that Valjean must stay free, however, for he has sworn to protect the baby daughter of Fantine, driven to prostitution by poverty.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Historical Fiction","Literature","France","Historical","Novels","...more"],"rating":4.21,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411852091i/24280.jpg","publishYear":1862,"numPages":1463,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24280.Les_Mis_rables"},{"id":"431","title":"The Grapes of Wrath (Hardcover)","author":"John Steinbeck","description":"The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers.

First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Historical Fiction","Literature","Novels","School","Historical","...more"],"rating":4.02,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375670575i/18114322.jpg","publishYear":1939,"numPages":496,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath"},{"id":"432","title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (Paperback)","author":"Mark Twain","description":"The exploits of Tom Sawyer, a consummate prankster with a quick wit, captivate children of all ages.

Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb introduction that although the violence of the Iliad is grim and relentless, it coexists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace. Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer’s poetry, and evokes the impact and nuance of the Iliad’s mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls “an astonishing performance.”","tags":["Classics","Poetry","Fiction","Mythology","Literature","Fantasy","Greek Mythology","...more"],"rating":3.93,"genres":["classics"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1681797700i/77265004.jpg","publishYear":0,"numPages":848,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77265004-the-iliad"},{"id":"434","title":"Treasure Island (Hardcover)","author":"Robert Louis Stevenson","description":"\\"For sheer storytelling delight and pure adventure, Treasure Island has never been surpassed.

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, Treasure Island is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like Treasure Island that can keep boys and old men happy.'","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Adventure","Historical Fiction","Young Adult","Childrens","Pirates","...more"],"rating":3.85,"genres":["adventure"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485248909i/295.jpg","publishYear":1882,"numPages":352,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295.Treasure_Island"},{"id":"435","title":"The Titan’s Curse (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #3)","author":"Rick Riordan","description":"It's not everyday you find yourself in combat with a half-lion, half-human.

She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.

Every year, Blue Sargent stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue herself never sees them—not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her. His name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble. But Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can’t entirely explain. He has it all—family money, good looks, devoted friends—but he’s looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little. For as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She never thought this would be a problem.

Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world... For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (\\"The\\") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will, and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge. Roald Dahl was a spy, ace fighter-pilot, chocolate historian, and medical inventor. He was also the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , Matilda , The BFG , and many more brilliant stories.

Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.\\" Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His \\"wonderful, awful\\" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all. Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos.","tags":["Childrens","Picture Books","Christmas","Classics","Fiction","Poetry","Fantasy","...more"],"rating":4.38,"genres":["children"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327958149i/113946.jpg","publishYear":1957,"numPages":64,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113946.How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_"},{"id":"487","title":"The BFG (Paperback)","author":"Roald Dahl","description":"Captured by a giant!

Well, if you don't know yet you'd better find out quickly-because there's nothing a witch loathes quite as much as children and she'll wield all kinds of terrifying powers to get rid of them.","tags":["Fantasy","Childrens","Fiction","Classics","Middle Grade","Young Adult","Witches","...more"],"rating":4.18,"genres":["children"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351707720i/6327.jpg","publishYear":1983,"numPages":208,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6327.The_Witches"},{"id":"489","title":"The Bad Beginning (A Series of Unfortunate Events, #1)","author":"Lemony Snicket","description":"Dear Reader, I'm sorry to say that the book you are holding in your hands is extremely unpleasant.

If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results. Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way. In Deep Work , author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four \\"rules,\\" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill. A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. Deep Work is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.","tags":["Nonfiction","Self Help","Productivity","Business","Psychology","Personal Development","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.16,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1447957962i/25744928.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":296,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work"},{"id":"512","title":"You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life (Paperback)","author":"Jen Sincero","description":"The #1 New York Times Bestseller You Are A Badass is the self-help book for people who desperately want to improve their lives but don't want to get busted doing it.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore Roosevelt Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts. In Daring Greatly , Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for, Daring Greatly will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.","tags":["Nonfiction","Self Help","Psychology","Personal Development","Audiobook","Leadership","Parenting","...more"],"rating":4.29,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1337110319i/13588356.jpg","publishYear":2012,"numPages":287,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588356-daring-greatly"},{"id":"515","title":"Think and Grow Rich (Paperback)","author":"Napoleon Hill","description":"Think and Grow Rich is a guide to success by Napoleon Hill, which was first published in 1937 following the Great Depression.

Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile. But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential. For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb. In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves.","tags":["Self Help","Nonfiction","Psychology","Personal Development","Audiobook","Mental Health","Poetry","...more"],"rating":4.05,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1590806892i/53642699.jpg","publishYear":2020,"numPages":250,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53642699-the-mountain-is-you"},{"id":"517","title":"12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (Hardcover)","author":"Jordan B.

What does the nervous system of the lowly lobster have to tell us about standing up straight (with our shoulders back) and about success in life? Why did ancient Egyptians worship the capacity to pay careful attention as the highest of gods? What dreadful paths do people tread when they become resentful, arrogant, and vengeful? Dr. Peterson journeys broadly, discussing discipline, freedom, adventure, and responsibility, distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical and profound rules for life. 12 Rules for Life shatters the modern commonplaces of science, faith, and human nature while transforming and ennobling the mind and spirit of its listeners.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Self Help","Philosophy","Personal Development","Audiobook","Unfinished","...more"],"rating":3.91,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1512705866i/30257963.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":409,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30257963-12-rules-for-life"},{"id":"518","title":"Rich Dad, Poor Dad (Paperback)","author":"Robert T.

The Courage to Be Disliked shows you how to unlock the power within yourself to become your best and truest self, change your future and find lasting happiness. Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of 19th-century psychology alongside Freud and Jung, the authors explain how we are all free to determine our own future free of the shackles of past experiences, doubts and the expectations of others. It’s a philosophy that’s profoundly liberating, allowing us to develop the courage to change, and to ignore the limitations that we and those around us can place on ourselves. The result is a book that is both highly accessible and profound in its importance. Millions have already read and benefited from its wisdom.

After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset — those who believe that abilities are fixed — are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset — those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love — to transform their lives and your own.","tags":["Psychology","Nonfiction","Self Help","Business","Personal Development","Education","Leadership","...more"],"rating":4.09,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436227012i/40745.jpg","publishYear":2006,"numPages":276,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset"},{"id":"523","title":"The 48 Laws of Power (Paperback)","author":"Robert Greene","description":"Amoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive, this multi-million-copy New York Times bestseller is the definitive manual for anyone interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate contro","fullDescription":"Amoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive, this multi-million-copy New York Times bestseller is the definitive manual for anyone interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control – from the author of The Laws of Human Nature . In the book that People magazine proclaimed “beguiling” and “fascinating,” Robert Greene and Joost Elffers have distilled three thousand years of the history of power into 48 essential laws by drawing from the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Carl Von Clausewitz and also from the lives of figures ranging from Henry Kissinger to P.T. Barnum. Some laws teach the need for prudence (“Law 1: Never Outshine the Master”), others teach the value of confidence (“Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness”), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (“Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally”).

It’s about getting only the right things done. Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin? Are you often busy but not productive? Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked? If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the Way of the Essentialist. Essentialism is more than a time-management technique. It is a systematic discipline for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution toward the things that really matter. By forcing us to apply more selective criteria for where to spend our precious time and energy, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices, instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us. Essentialism is not one more thing to do. It’s a whole new way of doing less, but better, in every area of our lives.

In this lively and compelling account, Rubin chronicles her adventures during the twelve months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier. Among other things, she found that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that money can help buy happiness, when spent wisely; that outer order contributes to inner calm; and that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference.","tags":["Nonfiction","Self Help","Memoir","Book Club","Psychology","Personal Development","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":3.65,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1256849491i/6398634.jpg","publishYear":2009,"numPages":301,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6398634-the-happiness-project"},{"id":"529","title":"How to Stop Worrying and Start Living: Time-Tested Methods for Conquering Worry (Paperback)","author":"Dale Carnegie","description":"The book 'How to stop worrying & start living' suggest many ways to conquer worry and lead a wonderful life.

Nobody needs to be told there isn’t enough time. We’re obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and ceaseless battle against distraction; we’re deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient and life hacks to optimize our days. But such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem: the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks. Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management. Rejecting the futile modern obsession with “getting everything done,” Four Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by embracing finitude, showing that many of the unhelpful ways we’ve come to think about time aren’t inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we’ve made as individuals and as a society—and that we could do things differently.","tags":["Nonfiction","Self Help","Productivity","Philosophy","Audiobook","Psychology","Personal Development","...more"],"rating":4.18,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1627425434i/54785515.jpg","publishYear":2021,"numPages":245,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks"},{"id":"531","title":"Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity (Paperback)","author":"David    Allen","description":"In today's world, yesterday's methods just don't work.

And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money--investing, personal finance, and business decisions--is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.

In this groundbreaking book, psychiatrist and neuroscientist Amir Levine and psychologist Rachel S. F. Heller reveal how an understanding of attachment theory-the most advanced relationship science in existence today-can help us find and sustain love. Attachment theory forms the basis for many bestselling books on the parent/child relationship, but there has yet to be an accessible guide to what this fascinating science has to tell us about adult romantic relationships-until now. Attachment theory owes its inception to British psychologist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby, who in the 1950s examined the tremendous impact that our early relationships with our parents or caregivers has on the people we become. Also central to attachment theory is the discovery that our need to be in a close relationship with one or more individuals is embedded in our genes. In Attached , Levine and Heller trace how these evolutionary influences continue to shape who we are in our relationships today. According to attachment theory, every person behaves in relationships in one of three distinct ways: * ANXIOUS people are often preoccupied with their relationships and tend to worry about their partner's ability to love them back. * AVOIDANT people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness. * SECURE people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving. Attached guides readers in determining what attachment style they and their mate (or potential mates) follow. It also offers readers a wealth of advice on how to navigate their relationships more wisely given their attachment style and that of their partner. An insightful look at the science behind love, Attached offers readers a road map for building stronger, more fulfilling connections.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Self Help","Relationships","Audiobook","Personal Development","Mental Health","...more"],"rating":4.13,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311705552i/9547888.jpg","publishYear":2010,"numPages":304,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9547888-attached"},{"id":"537","title":"101 Essays That Will Change The Way You Think (Kindle Edition)","author":"Brianna Wiest","description":"Over the past few years, Brianna Wiest has gained renown for her deeply moving, philosophical writing.

Why do some people succeed and others fail? Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments. Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not genius, but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own character lab and set out to test her theory. Here, she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers; from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of The New Yorker to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that not talent or luck makes all the difference.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Self Help","Business","Personal Development","Audiobook","Leadership","...more"],"rating":4.08,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1632024090i/27213329.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":277,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213329-grit"},{"id":"539","title":"Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World (Kindle Edition)","author":"Cal Newport","description":"Minimalism is the art of knowing how much is just enough.

It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world. In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives. Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience \\"fear of missing out\\" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction. Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions. Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day \\"digital declutter\\" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control. Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you.

One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but. As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients' lives -- a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a twenty-something who can't stop hooking up with the wrong guys -- she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell. With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change. Maybe You Should Talk to Someone is revolutionary in its candor, offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Memoir","Self Help","Mental Health","Book Club","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.37,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547189796i/37570546.jpg","publishYear":2019,"numPages":415,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570546-maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone"},{"id":"542","title":"Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It (Paperback)","author":"Chris Voss","description":"A former FBI hostage negotiator offers a new, field-tested approach to negotiating – effective in any situation.

A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had propelled him through the ranks of a hypercompetitive business, but had also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out. Eventually Harris stumbled upon an effective way to rein in that voice, something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation, a tool that research suggests can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain. \\"10% Happier\\" takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America's spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.","tags":["Nonfiction","Self Help","Psychology","Audiobook","Memoir","Meditation","Personal Development","...more"],"rating":3.91,"genres":["self-help"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451446393i/18505796.jpg","publishYear":2014,"numPages":256,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18505796-10-happier"},{"id":"545","title":"Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time (Paperback)","author":"Brian Tracy","description":"The legendary Eat That Frog!

It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love. Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.","tags":["Classics","Poetry","Fiction","Literature","Religion","Philosophy","Fantasy","...more"],"rating":3.85,"genres":["poetry"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1526070678i/15997.jpg","publishYear":1667,"numPages":453,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15997.Paradise_Lost"},{"id":"556","title":"Crush (Paperback)","author":"Richard Siken","description":"Richard Siken’s Crush , selected as the 2004 winner of the Yale Younger Poets prize, is a powerful collection of poems driven by panic and obsession.

Siken writes with ferocity, and his reader hurtles unstoppably with him. His poetry is confessional, gay, savage, and charged with violent eroticism. In the world of American poetry, Siken's voice is striking.

He then returns to his own country and dies in old age in a vivid fight against a dragon. The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on in the exhausted aftermath. In the contours of this story, at once remote and uncannily familiar at the beginning of the twenty-first century, Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney finds a resonance that summons power to the poetry from deep beneath its surface. Drawn to what he has called the \\"four-squareness of the utterance\\" in Beowulf and its immense emotional credibility, Heaney gives these epic qualities new and convincing reality for the contemporary reader.","tags":["Classics","Poetry","Fiction","Fantasy","Mythology","School","Literature","...more"],"rating":3.5,"genres":["poetry"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327878125i/52357.jpg","publishYear":1000,"numPages":259,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52357.Beowulf"},{"id":"558","title":"Home Body (Paperback)","author":"Rupi Kaur","description":"Rupi Kaur constantly embraces growth, and in home body, she walks readers through a reflective and intimate journey visiting the past, the present, and the potential of the self. home body is a collec","fullDescription":"Rupi Kaur constantly embraces growth, and in home body, she walks readers through a reflective and intimate journey visiting the past, the present, and the potential of the self. home body is a collection of raw, honest conversations with oneself – reminding readers to fill up on love, acceptance, community, family, and embrace change.

Critics attacked the poem's \\"kaleidoscopic\\" design, and nearly everyone disagreed furiously about its meaning. The poem was even rumored to a hoax. Eventually, though, The Waste Land went on to become what many regard as the most influential poem written in English in the twentieth century. \\"In ten years' time,\\" wrote Edmund Wilson in Axel's Castle (1931) , \\"Elliot has left upon English poetry a mark more unmistakable than that of any other poet writing in English.\\" In 1948, T.S.

But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself. So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out. But she still can’t stop thinking about performing her poems.

In these pages, Oliver shares the wonder of dawn, the grace of animals, and the transformative power of attention. Whether studying the leaves of a tree or mourning her adored dog, Percy, she is ever patient in her observations and open to the teachings contained in the smallest of moments. Our most precious chronicler of physical landscape, Oliver opens our eyes to the nature within, to its wild and its quiet. With startling clarity, humor, and kindness, A Thousand Mornings explores the mysteries of our daily experience.","tags":["Poetry","Nonfiction","Nature","Adult","Contemporary","LGBT","Classics","...more"],"rating":4.2,"genres":["poetry"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1345433150i/13588404.jpg","publishYear":2012,"numPages":82,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588404-a-thousand-mornings"},{"id":"568","title":"Citizen: An American Lyric (Paperback)","author":"Claudia Rankine","description":"A provocative meditation on race, Claudia Rankine's long-awaited follow up to her groundbreaking book Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric.

Claudia Rankine's bold new book recounts mounting racial aggressions in ongoing encounters in twenty-first-century daily life and in the media. Some of these encounters are slights, seeming slips of the tongue, and some are intentional offensives in the classroom, at the supermarket, at home, on the tennis court with Serena Williams and the soccer field with Zinedine Zidane, online, on TV-everywhere, all the time. The accumulative stresses come to bear on a person's ability to speak, perform, and stay alive. Our addressability is tied to the state of our belonging, Rankine argues, as are our assumptions and expectations of citizenship. In essay, image, and poetry, Citizen is a powerful testament to the individual and collective effects of racism in our contemporary, often named \\"post-race\\" society.","tags":["Poetry","Nonfiction","Race","Essays","Social Justice","Politics","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.25,"genres":["poetry"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420944502i/20613761.jpg","publishYear":2014,"numPages":169,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20613761-citizen"},{"id":"569","title":"The Complete Stories and Poems (Hardcover)","author":"Edgar Allan Poe","description":"Edgar Allan Poe was one of the most original writers in the history of American letters, a genius who was tragically misunderstood in his lifetime.

He was a seminal figure in the development of science fiction and the detective story, and exerted a great influence on Dostoyevsky, Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne, and Charles Baudelaire, who championed him long before Poe was appreciated in his own country. Baudelaire's enthusiasm brought Poe a wide audience in Europe, and his writing came to have enormous importance for modern French literature. This edition includes his most well-known works--\\"The Raven,\\" \\"The Pit and the Pendulum,\\" \\"Annabel Lee,\\" \\"The Fall of the House of Usher,\\" \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\"--as well as less-familiar stories, poems, and essays.","tags":["Classics","Poetry","Horror","Fiction","Short Stories","Gothic","Mystery","...more"],"rating":4.4,"genres":["poetry"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327942676i/23919.jpg","publishYear":1849,"numPages":821,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23919.The_Complete_Stories_and_Poems"},{"id":"570","title":"Devotions: The Selected Poems of Mary Oliver (Hardcover)","author":"Mary Oliver","description":"Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Mary Oliver presents a personal selection of her best work in this definitive collection spanning more than five decades of her esteemed literary career. “No matter where o","fullDescription":"Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Mary Oliver presents a personal selection of her best work in this definitive collection spanning more than five decades of her esteemed literary career. “No matter where one starts reading, Devotions offers much to love, from Oliver's exuberant dog poems to selections from the Pulitzer Prize-winning American Primitive, and Dream Work, one of her exceptional collections. Perhaps more important, the luminous writing provides respite from our crazy world and demonstrates how mindfulness can define and transform a life, moment by moment, poem by poem.” —The Washington Post “It’s as if the poet herself has sidled beside the reader and pointed us to the poems she considers most worthy of deep consideration.” —Chicago Tribune Throughout her celebrated career, Mary Oliver has touched countless readers with her brilliantly crafted verse, expounding on her love for the physical world and the powerful bonds between all living things. Identified as \\"far and away, this country's best selling poet\\" by Dwight Garner, she now returns with a stunning and definitive collection of her writing from the last fifty years. Carefully curated, these 200 plus poems feature Oliver's work from her very first book of poetry, No Voyage and Other Poems, published in 1963 at the age of 28, through her most recent collection, Felicity, published in 2015. This timeless volume, arranged by Oliver herself, showcases the beloved poet at her edifying best.

Shifting through memory, and in concert with the themes of his novel On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous , Vuong contends with personal loss, the meaning of family, and the cost of being the product of an American war in America. At once vivid, brave, and propulsive, Vuong's poems circle fragmented lives to find both restoration as well as the epicenter of the break. The author of the critically acclaimed poetry collection Night Sky With Exit Wounds , winner of the 2016 Whiting Award, the 2017 T.S. Eliot Prize, and a 2019 MacArthur fellow, Vuong writes directly to our humanity without losing sight of the current moment. These poems represent a more innovative and daring experimentation with language and form, illuminating how the themes we perennially live in and question are truly inexhaustible. Bold and prescient, and a testament to tenderness in the face of violence, Time Is a Mother is a return and a forging forth all at once.","tags":["Poetry","Queer","LGBT","Fiction","Contemporary","Audiobook","Adult","...more"],"rating":3.92,"genres":["poetry"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1626846358i/58582927.jpg","publishYear":2022,"numPages":114,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58582927-time-is-a-mother"},{"id":"572","title":"Inferno (Kindle Edition)","author":"Dante Alighieri","description":"Professor Esolen's translation of Dante's Inferno is the best one I have seen, for two reasons.

His decision to use unrhymed blank verse allows him to come nearly as close to the meaning of the original as any prose reading could do, and allows him also to avoid the harrowing sacrifices that the demand for rhyme imposes on any translator.

Kent Hieatt A groundbreaking bilingual edition of Dante's masterpiece that includes a substantive Introduction, extensive notes, and appendixes that reproduce Dante's key sources and influences. Of the great poets, Dante is one of the most elusive and therefore one of the most difficult to adequately render into English verse. With this major new translation, Anthony Esolen has succeeded brilliantly in marrying sense with sound, poetry with meaning, capturing both the poem's line-by-line vigor and its allegorically and philosophically exacting structure, yielding an Inferno that will be as popular with general readers as with scholars, teachers, and students. For, as Dante insists, without a trace of sentimentality or intellectual compromise, even Hell is a work of divine art. Esolen's edition also provides a critical ntroduction and endnotes, with appendices containing Dante's most important sources—from Virgil to Saint Thomas Aquinas and beyond —that deftly illuminate the religious universe the poet inhabited.

To my knowledge, she never scrapped any of her poetic efforts. With one or two exceptions, she brought every piece she worked on to some final form acceptable to her, rejecting at most the odd verse, or a false head or a false tail. Her attitude to her verse was artisan-like: if she couldn't get a table out of the material, she was quite happy to get a chair, or even a toy.

The work compiles two contrasting but directly related books of poetry by William Blake. Songs of Innocence honors and praises the natural world, the natural innocence of children and their close relationship to God. Songs of Experience contains much darker, disillusioned poems, which deal with serious, often political themes. It is believed that the disastrous end to the French Revolution produced this disillusionment in Blake.

Geryon, a young boy who is also a winged red monster, reveals the volcanic terrain of his fragile, tormented soul in an autobiography he begins at the age of five. As he grows older, Geryon escapes his abusive brother and affectionate but ineffectual mother, finding solace behind the lens of his camera and in the arms of a young man named Herakles, a cavalier drifter who leaves him at the peak of infatuation. When Herakles reappears years later, Geryon confronts again the pain of his desire and embarks on a journey that will unleash his creative imagination to its fullest extent. By turns whimsical and haunting, erudite and accessible, richly layered and deceptively simple, Autobiography of Red is a profoundly moving portrait of an artist coming to terms with the fantastic accident of who he is. \\"A profound love story . . . sensuous and funny, poignant, musical and tender.\\" -- The New York Times Book Review \\"A deeply odd and immensely engaging book. . . .

Mandelbaum’s astonishingly Dantean translation, which captures so much of the life of the original, renders whole for us the masterpiece of that genius whom our greatest poets have recognized as a central model for all poets.","tags":["Classics","Poetry","Fiction","Literature","Philosophy","Religion","Fantasy","...more"],"rating":4.08,"genres":["poetry"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1657540227i/6656.jpg","publishYear":1320,"numPages":798,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6656.The_Divine_Comedy"},{"id":"586","title":"Bright Dead Things (Paperback)","author":"Ada Limon","description":"Bright Dead Things examines the chaos that is life, the dangerous thrill of living in a world you know you have to leave one day, and the search to find something that is ultimately “disorderly, and m","fullDescription":"Bright Dead Things examines the chaos that is life, the dangerous thrill of living in a world you know you have to leave one day, and the search to find something that is ultimately “disorderly, and marvelous, and ours.” A book of bravado and introspection, of 21st century feminist swagger and harrowing terror and loss, this fourth collection considers how we build our identities out of place and human contact—tracing in intimate detail the various ways the speaker’s sense of self both shifts and perseveres as she moves from New York City to rural Kentucky, loses a dear parent, ages past the capriciousness of youth, and falls in love. Limón has often been a poet who wears her heart on her sleeve, but in these extraordinary poems that heart becomes a “huge beating genius machine” striving to embrace and understand the fullness of the present moment. “I am beautiful. I am full of love. I am dying,” the poet writes. Building on the legacies of forebears such as Frank O’Hara, Sharon Olds, and Mark Doty, Limón’s work is consistently generous and accessible—though every observed moment feels complexly thought, felt, and lived.","tags":["Poetry","Nonfiction","Feminism","LGBT","Queer","Contemporary","Adult","...more"],"rating":4.19,"genres":["poetry"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1424307716i/24945396.jpg","publishYear":2015,"numPages":105,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24945396-bright-dead-things"},{"id":"587","title":"Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass (Audible Audio)","author":"Lana Del Rey","description":"The highly anticipated spoken word poetry collection from Lana Del Rey, Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass “'Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass' is the title poem of the book and the first poem I ","fullDescription":"The highly anticipated spoken word poetry collection from Lana Del Rey, Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass “'Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass' is the title poem of the book and the first poem I wrote of many.

Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child’s soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson’s eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child.

Told with Sagan’s remarkable ability to make scientific ideas both comprehensible and exciting, Cosmos is about science in its broadest human context, how science and civilization grew up together. The book also explores spacecraft missions of discovery of the nearby planets, the research in the Library of ancient Alexandria, the human brain, Egyptian hieroglyphics, the origin of life, the death of the Sun, the evolution of galaxies and the origins of matter, suns and worlds. Sagan retraces the fifteen billion years of cos-mic evolution that have transformed matter into life and consciousness, enabling the Cosmos to wonder about itself. He considers the latest findings on life elsewhere and how we might communicate with the beings of other worlds. Cosmos is the story of our long journey of discovery and the forces and individuals who helped to shape modern science, including Democritus, Hypatia, Kepler, Newton, Huy-gens, Champollion, Lowell and Humason.

Today, physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small--General Relativity and Quantum Theory--is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and manifestations of one single entity: microscopically tiny vibrating loops of energy, a billionth of a billionth the size of an atom. In this brilliantly articulated and refreshingly clear book, Greene relates the scientific story and the human struggle behind twentieth-century physics' search for a theory of everything. Through the masterful use of metaphor and analogy, The Elegant Universe makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated viscerally accessible and thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works.","tags":["Science","Nonfiction","Physics","Astronomy","Popular Science","Space","Philosophy","...more"],"rating":4.1,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348791881i/8049273.jpg","publishYear":1999,"numPages":464,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8049273-the-elegant-universe"},{"id":"596","title":"The Origin of Species (Hardcover)","author":"Charles Darwin","description":"Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existenc","fullDescription":"Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task.

Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions. Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.","tags":["Science","Nonfiction","Philosophy","Religion","History","Skepticism","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.29,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553691804i/17349.jpg","publishYear":1995,"numPages":459,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World"},{"id":"598","title":"\\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\": Adventures of a Curious Character (Paperback)","author":"Richard P.

The story of the gene begins in an obscure Augustinian abbey in Moravia in 1856 where a monk stumbles on the idea of a ‘unit of heredity’. It intersects with Darwin’s theory of evolution, and collides with the horrors of Nazi eugenics in the 1940s. The gene transforms post-war biology. It reorganizes our understanding of sexuality, temperament, choice and free will. This is a story driven by human ingenuity and obsessive minds – from Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel to Francis Crick, James Watson and Rosalind Franklin, and the thousands of scientists still working to understand the code of codes. This is an epic, moving history of a scientific idea coming to life, by the author of The Emperor of All Maladies. But woven through The Gene, like a red line, is also an intimate history – the story of Mukherjee’s own family and its recurring pattern of mental illness, reminding us that genetics is vitally relevant to everyday lives. These concerns reverberate even more urgently today as we learn to “read” and “write” the human genome – unleashing the potential to change the fates and identities of our children. Majestic in its ambition, and unflinching in its honesty, The Gene gives us a definitive account of the fundamental unit of heredity – and a vision of both humanity’s past and future.","tags":["Science","Nonfiction","History","Biology","Medicine","Audiobook","Genetics","...more"],"rating":4.35,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1452452965i/27276428.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":592,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276428-the-gene"},{"id":"600","title":"The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements (Hardcover)","author":"Sam Kean","description":"Why did Gandhi hate iodine (I, 53)?

In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes.

The Emperor of All Maladies is a magnificent, profoundly humane “biography” of cancer - from its first documented appearances thousands of years ago through the epic battles in the twentieth century to cure, control, and conquer it to a radical new understanding of its essence. Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologist’s precision, a historian’s perspective, and a biographer’s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and perished from - for more than five thousand years. The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against cancer.” The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee’s own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive—and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. Riveting, urgent, and surprising, The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.","tags":["Nonfiction","Science","History","Medicine","Medical","Health","Biology","...more"],"rating":4.34,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1280771091i/7170627.jpg","publishYear":2010,"numPages":472,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7170627-the-emperor-of-all-maladies"},{"id":"603","title":"Seven Brief Lessons on Physics (Hardcover)","author":"Carlo Rovelli","description":"All the beauty of modern physics in fewer than a hundred pages.

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason. A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.'","tags":["Science","Nonfiction","Physics","Philosophy","Astronomy","Popular Science","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.06,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320558363i/8520362.jpg","publishYear":2010,"numPages":199,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520362-the-grand-design"},{"id":"606","title":"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution (Hardcover)","author":"Richard Dawkins","description":"Charles Darwin, whose 1859 masterpiece \\"On the Origin of Species\\" shook society to its core, would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy over evolution still raging 150 years la","fullDescription":"Charles Darwin, whose 1859 masterpiece \\"On the Origin of Species\\" shook society to its core, would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy over evolution still raging 150 years later. \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" is a stunning counter-attack on creationists, followers of \\"Intelligent Design\\" and all those who still question evolution as scientific fact. In this brilliant tour de force, Richard Dawkins pulls together the incontrovertible evidence that underpins it: from living examples of natural selection to clues in the fossil record; from plate tectonics to molecular genetics. \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" comes at a critical time as systematic opposition to the fact of evolution flourishes as never before in many schools worldwide.

With rigor and wit, Dawkins examines God in all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament, to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion, and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence. The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong, but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.","tags":["Nonfiction","Religion","Science","Philosophy","Atheism","Audiobook","Psychology","...more"],"rating":3.9,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347220693i/14743.jpg","publishYear":2006,"numPages":374,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14743.The_God_Delusion"},{"id":"608","title":"Brief Answers to the Big Questions (Hardcover)","author":"Stephen Hawking","description":"Stephen Hawking was recognized as one of the greatest minds of our time and a figure of inspiration after defying his ALS diagnosis at age twenty-one.

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking’s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context.  Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.","tags":["Science","Philosophy","Nonfiction","History","Sociology","History Of Science","Classics","...more"],"rating":4.03,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1396422530i/61539.jpg","publishYear":1962,"numPages":226,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61539.The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions"},{"id":"611","title":"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life (Hardcover)","author":"Ed Yong","description":"Every animal, whether human, squid, or wasp, is home to millions of bacteria and other microbes.

Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. In this astonishing book, Ed Yong takes us on a grand tour through our microbial partners, and introduces us to the scientists on the front lines of discovery. Yong, whose humor is as evident as his erudition, prompts us to look at ourselves and our animal companions in a new light—less as individuals and more as the interconnected, interdependent multitudes we assuredly are. The microbes in our bodies are part of our immune systems and protect us from disease. Those in cows and termites digest the plants they eat. In the deep oceans, mysterious creatures without mouths or guts depend on microbes for all their energy. Bacteria provide squids with invisibility cloaks, help beetles to bring down forests, and allow worms to cause diseases that afflict millions of people. I Contain Multitudes is the story of these extraordinary partnerships, between the creatures we are familiar with and those we are not. It reveals how we humans are disrupting these partnerships and how we might manipulate them for our own good. It will change both our view of nature and our sense of where we belong in it.","tags":["Science","Nonfiction","Biology","Health","Audiobook","Medicine","Nature","...more"],"rating":4.18,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445606162i/27213168.jpg","publishYear":2016,"numPages":368,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213168-i-contain-multitudes"},{"id":"612","title":"Chaos: Making a New Science (Paperback)","author":"James Gleick","description":"A work of popular science in the tradition of Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan, this 20th-anniversary edition of James Gleick’s groundbreaking bestseller Chaos introduces a whole new readership to chaos","fullDescription":"A work of popular science in the tradition of Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan, this 20th-anniversary edition of James Gleick’s groundbreaking bestseller Chaos introduces a whole new readership to chaos theory, one of the most significant waves of scientific knowledge in our time.

More than a decade in the making, this game-changing book is Robert Sapolsky's genre-shattering attempt to answer that question as fully as perhaps only he could, looking at it from every angle. Sapolsky's storytelling concept is delightful but it also has a powerful intrinsic logic: he starts by looking at the factors that bear on a person's reaction in the precise moment a behavior occurs, and then hops back in time from there, in stages, ultimately ending up at the deep history of our species and its evolutionary legacy. And so the first category of explanation is the neurobiological one. A behavior occurs—whether an example of humans at our best, worst, or somewhere in between. What went on in a person's brain a second before the behavior happened? Then Sapolsky pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: What sight, sound, or smell caused the nervous system to produce that behavior? And then, what hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual is to the stimuli that triggered the nervous system? By now he has increased our field of vision so that we are thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and endocrinology in trying to explain what happened. Sapolsky keeps going: How was that behavior influenced by structural changes in the nervous system over the preceding months, by that person's adolescence, childhood, fetal life, and then back to his or her genetic makeup? Finally, he expands the view to encompass factors larger than one individual. How did culture shape that individual's group, what ecological factors millennia old formed that culture? And on and on, back to evolutionary factors millions of years old. The result is one of the most dazzling tours d'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, a majestic synthesis that harvests cutting-edge research across a range of disciplines to provide a subtle and nuanced perspective on why we ultimately do the things we do ... for good and for ill. Sapolsky builds on this understanding to wrestle with some of our deepest and thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, morality and free will, and war and peace. Wise, humane, often very funny, Behave is a towering achievement, powerfully humanizing, and downright heroic in its own right.","tags":["Science","Nonfiction","Psychology","Biology","Neuroscience","Philosophy","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.39,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1517732866i/31170723.jpg","publishYear":2017,"numPages":790,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31170723-behave"},{"id":"619","title":"Bad Science (Paperback)","author":"Ben Goldacre","description":"How do we know if a treatment works, or if something causes cancer?

Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group. Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents the science behind the secret and previously unknown life of trees and their communication abilities; he describes how these discoveries have informed his own practices in the forest around him. As he says, a happy forest is a healthy forest, and he believes that eco-friendly practices not only are economically sustainable but also benefit the health of our planet and the mental and physical health of all who live on Earth.","tags":["Nonfiction","Science","Nature","Audiobook","Environment","Biology","Ecology","...more"],"rating":4.07,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1464281905i/28256439.jpg","publishYear":2015,"numPages":272,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28256439-the-hidden-life-of-trees"},{"id":"621","title":"Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds & Shape Our Futures (Hardcover)","author":"Merlin Sheldrake","description":"There is a lifeform so strange and wondrous that it forces us to rethink how life works… Neither plant nor animal, it is found throughout the earth, the air and our bodies.

It can be microscopic, yet also accounts for the largest organisms ever recorded, living for millennia and weighing tens of thousands of tonnes. Its ability to digest rock enabled the first life on land, it can survive unprotected in space, and thrives amidst nuclear radiation. In this captivating adventure, Merlin Sheldrake explores the spectacular and neglected world of fungi: endlessly surprising organisms that sustain nearly all living systems. They can solve problems without a brain, stretching traditional definitions of ‘intelligence’, and can manipulate animal behaviour with devastating precision. In giving us bread, alcohol and life-saving medicines, fungi have shaped human history, and their psychedelic properties, which have influenced societies since antiquity, have recently been shown to alleviate a number of mental illnesses. The ability of fungi to digest plastic, explosives, pesticides and crude oil is being harnessed in break-through technologies, and the discovery that they connect plants in underground networks, the ‘Wood Wide Web’, is transforming the way we understand ecosystems. Yet they live their lives largely out of sight, and over ninety percent of their species remain undocumented. Entangled Life is a mind-altering journey into this hidden kingdom of life, and shows that fungi are key to understanding the planet on which we live, and the ways we think, feel and behave. The more we learn about fungi, the less makes sense without them.","tags":["Nonfiction","Science","Nature","Biology","Audiobook","Environment","Ecology","...more"],"rating":4.33,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575341220l/52668915.jpg","publishYear":2020,"numPages":352,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52668915-entangled-life"},{"id":"622","title":"The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World (Hardcover)","author":"Steve Brusatte","description":"The dinosaurs .

Today they remain one of our planet’s great mysteries. Now The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs reveals their extraordinary, 200-million-year-long story as never before. In this captivating narrative (enlivened with more than seventy original illustrations and photographs), Steve Brusatte, a young American paleontologist who has emerged as one of the foremost stars of the field—naming fifteen new species and leading groundbreaking scientific studies and fieldwork—masterfully tells the complete, surprising, and new history of the dinosaurs, drawing on cutting-edge science to dramatically bring to life their lost world and illuminate their enigmatic origins, spectacular flourishing, astonishing diversity, cataclysmic extinction, and startling living legacy. Captivating and revelatory, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a book for the ages. Brusatte traces the evolution of dinosaurs from their inauspicious start as small shadow dwellers—themselves the beneficiaries of a mass extinction caused by volcanic eruptions at the beginning of the Triassic period—into the dominant array of species every wide-eyed child memorizes today, T. rex , Triceratops , Brontosaurus , and more. This gifted scientist and writer re-creates the dinosaurs’ peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs, the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in earth’s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a “sixth extinction.” Brusatte also recalls compelling stories from his globe-trotting expeditions during one of the most exciting eras in dinosaur research—which he calls “a new golden age of discovery”—and offers thrilling accounts of some of the remarkable findings he and his colleagues have made, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs; monstrous carnivores even larger than T. rex; and paradigm-shifting feathered raptors from China. An electrifying scientific history that unearths the dinosaurs’ epic saga, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs will be a definitive and treasured account for decades to come. Includes 75 images, world maps of the prehistoric earth, and a dinosaur family tree.","tags":["Nonfiction","Science","History","Audiobook","Nature","Dinosaurs","Animals","...more"],"rating":4.21,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1515529573i/35820369.jpg","publishYear":2018,"numPages":404,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35820369-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dinosaurs"},{"id":"623","title":"Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries (Paperback)","author":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","description":"A vibrant collection of essays on the cosmos from the nation's best-known astrophysicist. \\"One of today's best popularizers of science.\\" —Kirkus Reviews.

One hundred years ago, scientists would have said that lasers, televisions, and the atomic bomb were beyond the realm of physical possibility. In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future. From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals—and the limits—of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories—Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains: · How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers “downstream” · How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars · How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology · Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build one Kaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it. An extraordinary scientific adventure, Physics of the Impossible takes readers on an unforgettable, mesmerizing journey into the world of science that both enlightens and entertains.","tags":["Science","Nonfiction","Physics","Popular Science","Technology","Astronomy","Space","...more"],"rating":4.09,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320469147i/1168341.jpg","publishYear":2008,"numPages":329,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1168341.Physics_of_the_Impossible"},{"id":"625","title":"The Order of Time (Hardcover)","author":"Carlo Rovelli","description":"Time is a mystery that does not cease to puzzle us.

Philosophers, artists and poets have long explored its meaning while scientists have found that its structure is different from the simple intuition we have of it. From Boltzmann to quantum theory, from Einstein to loop quantum gravity, our understanding of time has been undergoing radical transformations. Time flows at different speeds in different places, the past and the future differ far less than we might think and the very notion of the present evaporates in the vast universe. With his extraordinary charm and sense of wonder, bringing together science, philosophy and art, Carlo Rovelli unravels this mystery, inviting us to imagine a world where time is in us and we are not in time.","tags":["Science","Nonfiction","Physics","Philosophy","Audiobook","Popular Science","History","...more"],"rating":4.13,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1516424407i/36442813.jpg","publishYear":2017,"numPages":224,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36442813-the-order-of-time"},{"id":"626","title":"Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters (Paperback)","author":"Matt Ridley","description":"“Ridley leaps from chromosome to chromosome in a handy summation of our ever increasing understanding of the roles that genes play in disease, behavior, sexual differences, and even intelligence. . .

He addresses not only the ethical quandaries faced by contemporary scientists but the reductionist danger in equating inheritability with inevitability.” — The New Yorker The genome's been mapped. But what does it mean? Matt Ridley’s Genome is the book that explains it what it is, how it works, and what it portends for the future Arguably the most significant scientific discovery of the new century, the mapping of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genome raises almost as many questions as it answers. Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will. Questions that will affect the rest of your life. Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From Huntington's disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome. It will help you understand what this scientific milestone means for you, for your children, and for humankind.","tags":["Science","Nonfiction","Biology","Genetics","Evolution","Popular Science","History","...more"],"rating":4.06,"genres":["science"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439697027i/4591.jpg","publishYear":1999,"numPages":344,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4591.Genome"},{"id":"627","title":"Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher (Paperback)","author":"Richard P.

What was there before it? What will the future bring? And finally, why is there something rather than nothing?” One of the few prominent scientists today to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss describes the staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories that demonstrate not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. With a new preface about the significance of the discovery of the Higgs particle, A Universe from Nothing uses Krauss’s characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear explanations to take us back to the beginning of the beginning, presenting the most recent evidence for how our universe evolved—and the implications for how it’s going to end.

Are breasts, sweat glands, and scales connected in some way? To better understand the inner workings of our bodies and to trace the origins of many of today's most common diseases, we have to turn to unexpected sources: worms, flies, and even fish. Neil Shubin, a leading paleontologist and professor of anatomy who discovered Tiktaalik-the \\"missing link\\" that made headlines around the world in April 2006-tells the story of evolution by tracing the organs of the human body back millions of years, long before the first creatures walked the earth. By examining fossils and DNA, Shubin shows us that our hands actually resemble fish fins, our head is organized like that of a long-extinct jawless fish, and major parts of our genome look and function like those of worms and bacteria. Shubin makes us see ourselves and our world in a completely new light.

Hollingdale with an introduction by Michael Tanner in Penguin Classics. Beyond Good and Evil confirmed Nietzsche's position as the towering European philosopher of his age. The work dramatically rejects the tradition of Western thought with its notions of truth and God, good and evil. Nietzsche demonstrates that the Christian world is steeped in a false piety and infected with a 'slave morality'. With wit and energy, he turns from this critique to a philosophy that celebrates the present and demands that the individual imposes their own 'will to power' upon the world. This edition includes a commentary on the text by the translator and Michael Tanner's introduction, which explains some of the more abstract passages in Beyond Good and Evil . Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable. If you enjoyed Beyond Good and Evil you might like Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra , also available in Penguin Classics. \\"One of the greatest books of a very great thinker.\\" —Michael Tanner","tags":["Philosophy","Nonfiction","Classics","Psychology","German Literature","Religion","History","...more"],"rating":4.03,"genres":["philosophy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388607391i/12321.jpg","publishYear":1886,"numPages":240,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12321.Beyond_Good_and_Evil"},{"id":"632","title":"The Republic (Paperback)","author":"Plato","description":"Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, this classic text is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it.

It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor. Nietzsche's utterance 'God is dead', his insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms, and his doctrine of the Superman and the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by, among others, Nazi intellectuals. With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance, Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority, but in an all-powerful life passionate, chaotic and free.","tags":["Philosophy","Classics","Nonfiction","German Literature","Literature","Psychology","Religion","...more"],"rating":4.07,"genres":["philosophy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1650680683i/51893.jpg","publishYear":1883,"numPages":327,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51893.Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra"},{"id":"635","title":"Tao Te Ching (Paperback)","author":"Lao Tzu","description":"A lucid translation of the well-known Taoist classic by a leading scholar-now in a Shambhala Pocket Library edition.

Written more than two thousand years ago, the Tao Teh Ching , or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the Tao Teh Ching teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. John C. H. Wu has done a remarkable job of rendering this subtle text into English while retaining the freshness and depth of the original. A jurist and scholar, Dr. Wu was a recognized authority on Taoism and the translator of several Taoist and Zen texts and of Chinese poetry. This book is part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts.

Reason, Kant argues, is the seat of certain concepts that precede experience and make it possible, but we are not therefore entitled to draw conclusions about the natural world from these concepts. The Critique brings together the two opposing schools of philosophy: rationalism, which grounds all our knowledge in reason, and empiricism, which traces all our knowledge to experience.

No man can live a happy life, or even a supportable life, without the study of wisdom Lucius Annaeus Seneca (4 BC-AD 65) is one of the most famous Roman philosophers. Instrumental in guiding the Roman Empire under emperor Nero, Seneca influenced him from a young age with his Stoic principles. Later in life, he wrote Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, or Letters from a Stoic, detailing these principles in full. Seneca’s letters read like a diary or a handbook of philosophical meditations. Often beginning with observations on daily life, the letters focus on many traditional themes of Stoic philosophy, such as the contempt of death, the value of friendship, and virtue as the supreme good. Using Gummere’s translation from the early twentieth century, this selection of Seneca’s letters shows his belief in the austere, ethical ideals of Stoicism – teachings we can still learn from today.","tags":["Philosophy","Nonfiction","Classics","History","Self Help","Psychology","Personal Development","...more"],"rating":4.33,"genres":["philosophy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421619214i/97411.jpg","publishYear":0,"numPages":254,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97411.Letters_from_a_Stoic"},{"id":"643","title":"The Symposium (Paperback)","author":"Plato","description":"A fascinating discussion on sex, gender, and human instincts, as relevant today as ever.

In the course of a lively drinking party, a group of Athenian intellectuals exchange views on eros, or desire. From their conversation emerges a series of subtle reflections on gender roles, sex in society and the sublimation of basic human instincts. The discussion culminates in a radical challenge to conventional views by Plato's mentor, Socrates, who advocates transcendence through spiritual love. The Symposium is a deft interweaving of different viewpoints and ideas about the nature of love--as a response to beauty, a cosmic force, a motive for social action and as a means of ethical education.

He is regarded as a leading pioneer of existentialism and one of the greatest philosophers of the 19th Century. In Fear and Trembling , Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God commanded him to offer his son as a human sacrifice. Abraham had a choice to complete the task or to forget it. He resigned himself to the loss of his son, acting according to his faith. In other words, one must be willing to give up all his or her earthly possessions in infinite resignation and must also be willing to give up whatever it is that he or she loves more than God. Abraham had passed the test -- his love for God proved greater than anything else in him. And because a good and just Creator would not want a father to kill his son, God intervened at the last moment to prevent the sacrifice.","tags":["Philosophy","Nonfiction","Religion","Classics","Theology","Christianity","Psychology","...more"],"rating":4,"genres":["philosophy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309286516i/24965.jpg","publishYear":1843,"numPages":152,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24965.Fear_and_Trembling"},{"id":"650","title":"On the Genealogy of Morals (Paperback)","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","description":"On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) is a book about the history of ethics and about interpretation.

Nietzsche rewrites the former as a history of cruelty, exposing the central values of the Judaeo-Christian and liberal traditions - compassion, equality, justice - as the product of a brutal process of conditioning designed to domesticate the animal vitality of earlier cultures. The result is a book which raises profoundly disquieting issues about the violence of both ethics and interpretation. Nietzsche questions moral certainties by showing that religion and science have no claim to absolute truth, before turning on his own arguments in order to call their very presuppositions into question. The Genealogy is the most sustained of Nietzsche's later works and offers one of the fullest expressions of his characteristic concerns.

The unstated objective of his lecture (“Existentialism Is a Humanism”) was to expound his philosophy as a form of “existentialism,” a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity. The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre’s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence—his self, his being—through the choices he freely makes (“existence precedes essence”). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind. This book presents a new English translation of Sartre’s 1945 lecture and his analysis of Camus’s The Stranger , along with a discussion of these works by acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal.

Sold as a child and crippled from the beatings of his master, Epictetus was eventually freed, rising from his humble roots to establish an influential school of Stoic philosophy. Stressing that human beings cannot control life, only how they respond to it, Epictetus dedicated his life to outlining the simple way to happiness, fulfillment, and tranquility. By putting into practice the ninety-three witty, wise, and razor-sharp instructions that make up The Art of Living , readers learn to successfully meet the challenges of everyday life and face life's inevitable losses and disappointments with grace. Epictetus's teachings rank among the greatest wisdom texts of human civilization.

Thoreau lived alone in a secluded cabin at Walden Pond. It is one of the most influential and compelling books in American literature. This new paperback edition-introduced by noted American writer John Updike-celebrates the 150th anniversary of this classic work. Much of Walden's material is derived from Thoreau's journals and contains such engaging pieces as \\"Reading\\" and \\"The Pond in the Winter\\" Other famous sections involve Thoreau's visits with a Canadian woodcutter and with an Irish family, a trip to Concord, and a description of his bean field. This is the complete and authoritative text of Walden-as close to Thoreau's original intention as all available evidence allows. For the student and for the general reader, this is the ideal presentation of Thoreau's great document of social criticism and dissent.","tags":["Classics","Philosophy","Nonfiction","Nature","Memoir","Literature","Biography","...more"],"rating":3.77,"genres":["philosophy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630470982i/16902.jpg","publishYear":1854,"numPages":352,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16902.Walden_or_Life_in_the_Woods"},{"id":"663","title":"The Problems of Philosophy (Paperback)","author":"Bertrand Russell","description":"A lively and still one of the best introductions to philosophy, this book pays off both a closer reading for students and specialists, and a casual reading for the general public.","fullDescription":"A lively and still one of the best introductions to philosophy, this book pays off both a closer reading for students and specialists, and a casual reading for the general public.","tags":["Philosophy","Nonfiction","Classics","History","Science","Audiobook","Essays","...more"],"rating":3.9,"genres":["philosophy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405495766i/31799.jpg","publishYear":1912,"numPages":116,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31799.The_Problems_of_Philosophy"},{"id":"664","title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (Paperback)","author":"David Hume","description":"La Investigación sobre el conocimiento humano constituye la exposición más coherente y madura de las ideas de David Hume (1711-1776).

Along with his teacher Socrates and his pupil Aristotle, he can be said to have laid the foundations for Western philosophy, science and ethics, as well as establishing the first academy for higher learning in the Western world. Socrates is one of the great figures of Western history and the founding father of its philosophical tradition. In the Dialogues, by his pupil and fellow philosopher Plato, a fascinating portrait emerges of a man who spurned material wealth and believed above all in learning and inquiry. Apology, Crito, and Phaedo recount Socrates’ trial on charges of corrupting the youth of Athens, his defiance of the court, and his last days in jail passed in discussion with friends. They form an excellent introduction to a courageous and captivating figure who paid with his life for the right to free thought.","tags":["Philosophy","Classics","Nonfiction","History","School","Politics","Biography","...more"],"rating":4.12,"genres":["philosophy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388197286i/22632.jpg","publishYear":0,"numPages":58,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22632.The_Trial_and_Death_of_Socrates"},{"id":"666","title":"Politics (Paperback)","author":"Aristotle","description":"What is the relationship of the individual to the state?

Barely two hundred and fifty years ago a man condemned of attempting to assassinate the King of France was drawn and quartered in a grisly spectacle that suggested an unmediated duel between the violence of the criminal and the violence of the state. This groundbreaking book by the most influential philosopher since Sartre compels us to reevaluate our assumptions about all the ensuing reforms in the penal institutions of the West. For as he examines innovations that range from the abolition of torture to the institution of forced labor and the appearance of the modern penitentiary, Michel Foucault suggests that punishment has shifted its focus from the prisoner's body to the soul — and that our very concern with rehabilitation encourages and refines criminal activity. Lucidly reasoned and deftly marshaling a vast body of research, Discipline and Punish is a genuinely revolutionary book, whose implications extend beyond the prison to the minute power relations of our society.","tags":["Philosophy","Nonfiction","History","Sociology","Theory","Politics","Psychology","...more"],"rating":4.24,"genres":["philosophy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400737037i/80369.jpg","publishYear":1975,"numPages":333,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80369.Discipline_and_Punish"},{"id":"671","title":"Phenomenology of Spirit (Paperback)","author":"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel","description":"Perhaps one of the most revolutionary works of philosophy ever presented, The Phenomenology of Spirit is Hegel's 1807 work that is in numerous ways extraordinary.

It tells the story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view. The book tells a gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion. The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings; the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Philosophy","France","Literature","French Literature","Novels","...more"],"rating":4.02,"genres":["philosophy"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503362434i/11989.jpg","publishYear":1947,"numPages":308,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11989.The_Plague"},{"id":"674","title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy (Paperback)","author":"René Descartes","description":"Rene Descartes has often been called the father of modern philosophy, and it is certainly true that his influence has pervaded western thought at least until the present century.

Why does recalling the Ten Commandments reduce our tendency to lie, even when we couldn't possibly be caught? Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save twenty-five cents on a can of soup? Why do we go back for second helpings at the unlimited buffet, even when our stomachs are already full? And how did we ever start spending $4.15 on a cup of coffee when, just a few years ago, we used to pay less than a dollar? When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we're in control. We think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we? In a series of illuminating, often surprising experiments, MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities. Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same \\"types\\" of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us \\"predictably\\" irrational. From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions. \\"Predictably Irrational\\" will change the way we interact with the world--one small decision at a time.","tags":["Psychology","Nonfiction","Economics","Business","Science","Self Help","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.12,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1255573980i/1713426.jpg","publishYear":2008,"numPages":247,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1713426.Predictably_Irrational"},{"id":"679","title":"Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ (Hardcover)","author":"Daniel Goleman","description":"The groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be smart, with a new introduction by the author.

Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence, we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our “two minds”—the rational and the emotional—and how they together shape our destiny. Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart—and they aren’t fixed at birth. Although shaped by childhood experiences, emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened throughout our adulthood—with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work. The twenty-fifth-anniversary edition of Emotional Intelligence could not come at a better time—we spend so much of our time online, more and more jobs are becoming automated and digitized, and our children are picking up new technology faster than we ever imagined.

The Psychopath Test is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath. Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Science","Audiobook","Mental Health","Book Club","Sociology","...more"],"rating":3.95,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364166270i/12391521.jpg","publishYear":2011,"numPages":275,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12391521-the-psychopath-test"},{"id":"682","title":"Man and His Symbols (Mass Market Paperback)","author":"C.G.

Thus, the reader will gain new insights into himself from this thoughtful volume, which also illustrates symbols throughout history. Completed just before his death by Jung and his associates, it is clearly addressed to the general reader.","tags":["Psychology","Philosophy","Nonfiction","Science","Mythology","Psychoanalysis","Classics","...more"],"rating":4.19,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1751072484i/123632.jpg","publishYear":1964,"numPages":415,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123632.Man_and_His_Symbols"},{"id":"683","title":"Menti tribali.

Da vent’anni, lo psicologo morale e filosofo Jonathan Haidt indaga i meccanismi profondi che regolano la nostra esistenza, le decisioni che prendiamo, i valori che crediamo universali, che condividiamo o che rifiutiamo. Secondo Haidt il giudizio morale è la bussola che, dalle piccole scelte quotidiane ai grandi temi della politica e della religione, orienta la tendenza naturale dell’uomo a riunirsi in tribù e a dividersi su ciò che si ritiene essere giusto o sbagliato. Arrivato ai vertici della classifica del “New York Times”, Menti tribali è un libro che propone una via alla convivenza e al dialogo, partendo dalla comprensione dei processi biologici ancestrali da cui nasce la nostra ricerca del bene.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Politics","Philosophy","Religion","Science","Sociology","...more"],"rating":4.2,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1680445605i/124939807.jpg","publishYear":2012,"numPages":420,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124939807-menti-tribali-perch-le-brave-persone-si-dividono-su-politica-e-religio"},{"id":"684","title":"Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know About the People We Don't Know (Hardcover)","author":"Malcolm Gladwell","description":"Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Outliers , offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they oft","fullDescription":"Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Outliers , offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they often go wrong. How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true? While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's \\"Hell You Talmbout.\\" Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Audiobook","Self Help","Sociology","Science","Business","...more"],"rating":4,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549393502i/43848929.jpg","publishYear":2019,"numPages":388,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43848929-talking-to-strangers"},{"id":"685","title":"Games People Play (Mass Market Paperback)","author":"Eric Berne","description":"We think we’re relating to other people–but actually we’re all playing games.

Forty years ago, Games People Play revolutionized our understanding of what really goes on during our most basic social interactions. More than five million copies later, Dr. Eric Berne’s classic is as astonishing–and revealing–as it was on the day it was first published. This anniversary edition features a new introduction by Dr. James R. Allen, president of the International Transactional Analysis Association, and Kurt Vonnegut’s brilliant Life magazine review from 1965. We play games all the time–sexual games, marital games, power games with our bosses, and competitive games with our friends. Detailing status contests like “Martini” (I know a better way), to lethal couples combat like “If It Weren’t For You” and “Uproar,” to flirtation favorites like “The Stocking Game” and “Let’s You and Him Fight,” Dr. Berne exposes the secret ploys and unconscious maneuvers that rule our intimate lives. Explosive when it first appeared, Games People Play is now widely recognized as the most original and influential popular psychology book of our time. It’s as powerful and eye-opening as ever.","tags":["Psychology","Nonfiction","Self Help","Science","Philosophy","Relationships","Personal Development","...more"],"rating":3.72,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1628756599i/49176.jpg","publishYear":1964,"numPages":192,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49176.Games_People_Play"},{"id":"686","title":"The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil (Hardcover)","author":"Philip G.

Here, for the first time and in detail, Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment, the landmark study in which a group of college-student volunteers was randomly divided into “guards” and “inmates” and then placed in a mock prison environment. Within a week the study was abandoned, as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal, sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners.By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses, Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena, from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib. He replaces the long-held notion of the “bad apple” with that of the “bad barrel”—the idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual, rather than the other way around.This is a book that dares to hold a mirror up to mankind, showing us that we might not be who we think we are. While forcing us to reexamine what we are capable of doing when caught up in the crucible of behavioral dynamics, though, Zimbardo also offers hope. We are capable of resisting evil, he argues, and can even teach ourselves to act heroically. Like Hannah Arendt’s Eichmann in Jerusalem and Steven Pinker’s The Blank Slate, The Lucifer Effect is a shocking, engrossing study that will change the way we view human behavior.","tags":["Psychology","Nonfiction","Science","Philosophy","Sociology","Self Help","History","...more"],"rating":3.91,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388365513i/359194.jpg","publishYear":2007,"numPages":551,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359194.The_Lucifer_Effect"},{"id":"687","title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections (Paperback)","author":"C.G.

That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others ). In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction—at work, at school, and at home—is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation—autonomy, mastery, and purpose—and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.","tags":["Nonfiction","Business","Psychology","Leadership","Self Help","Personal Development","Management","...more"],"rating":3.95,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348931599i/6452796.jpg","publishYear":2009,"numPages":242,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive"},{"id":"690","title":"An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness (Paperback)","author":"Kay Redfield Jamison","description":"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A deeply powerful memoir about bipolar illness that has both transformed and saved lives—with a new preface by the author.

In this brilliant, witty, and accessible book, renowned Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert describes the foibles of imagination and illusions of foresight that cause each of us to mis-conceive our tomorrows and mis-estimate our satisfactions. Vividly bringing to life the latest scientific research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral economics, Gilbert reveals what scientists have discovered about the uniquely human ability to imagine the future, and about our capacity to predict how much we will like it when we get there. With penetrating insight and sparkling prose, Gilbert explains why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the people we are about to become.","tags":["Psychology","Nonfiction","Self Help","Science","Personal Development","Philosophy","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":3.82,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327947323i/56627.jpg","publishYear":2006,"numPages":263,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56627.Stumbling_on_Happiness"},{"id":"692","title":"The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom (Paperback)","author":"Jonathan Haidt","description":"In his widely praised book, award-winning psychologist Jonathan Haidt examines the world’s philosophical wisdom through the lens of psychological science, showing how a deeper understanding of endurin","fullDescription":"In his widely praised book, award-winning psychologist Jonathan Haidt examines the world’s philosophical wisdom through the lens of psychological science, showing how a deeper understanding of enduring maxims-like Do unto others as you would have others do unto you, or What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger-can enrich and even transform our lives.","tags":["Psychology","Nonfiction","Philosophy","Self Help","Science","Personal Development","Audiobook","...more"],"rating":4.09,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348779688i/96884.jpg","publishYear":2006,"numPages":297,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96884.The_Happiness_Hypothesis"},{"id":"693","title":"Civilization and Its Discontents (Paperback)","author":"Sigmund Freud","description":"l malestar en la cultura”, trabajo en el que Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) sentó que nuestra especie ha pagado por el progreso el elevado precio de sacrificar la vida instintiva y reprimir la espontaneida","fullDescription":"l malestar en la cultura”, trabajo en el que Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) sentó que nuestra especie ha pagado por el progreso el elevado precio de sacrificar la vida instintiva y reprimir la espontaneidad, es uno de los ensayos con más amplias repercusiones en el pensamiento del siglo XX por su rara clarividencia.

Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nudge is about how we make these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples and drawing on decades of behavioral science research, Nobel Prize winner Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way, and that we are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. But by knowing how people think, we can use sensible “choice architecture” to nudge people toward the best decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society, without restricting our freedom of choice.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Economics","Business","Self Help","Science","Politics","...more"],"rating":3.84,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348322381i/3450744.jpg","publishYear":2008,"numPages":260,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3450744-nudge"},{"id":"696","title":"Love's Executioner and Other Tales of Psychotherapy (Paperback)","author":"Irvin D.

It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very lives.” —Oprah Winfrey This book is going to change the way you see your life. Have you ever wondered \\"Why did I do that?\\" or \\"Why can't I just control my behavior?\\" Others may judge our reactions and think, \\"What's wrong with that person?\\" When questioning our emotions, it's easy to place the blame on ourselves; holding ourselves and those around us to an impossible standard. It's time we started asking a different question. Through deeply personal conversations, Oprah Winfrey and renowned brain and trauma expert Dr. Bruce Perry offer a groundbreaking and profound shift from asking “What’s wrong with you?” to “What happened to you?” Here, Winfrey shares stories from her own past, understanding through experience the vulnerability that comes from facing trauma and adversity at a young age. In conversation throughout the book, she and Dr. Perry focus on understanding people, behavior, and ourselves. It’s a subtle but profound shift in our approach to trauma, and it’s one that allows us to understand our pasts in order to clear a path to our future—opening the door to resilience and healing in a proven, powerful way.","tags":["Nonfiction","Psychology","Self Help","Audiobook","Mental Health","Personal Development","Health","...more"],"rating":4.42,"genres":["psychology"],"coverImage":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1653552093i/53238858.jpg","publishYear":2021,"numPages":304,"book_url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53238858-what-happened-to-you"},{"id":"698","title":"How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics (Hardcover)","author":"Michael Pollan","description":"Could psychedelic drugs change our worldview?

One of America's most admired writers takes us on a mind-altering journey to the frontiers of human consciousness When LSD was first discovered in the 1940s, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as if the world might be on the cusp of psychological revolution. It promised to shed light on the deep mysteries of consciousness, as well as offer relief to addicts and the mentally ill. But in the 1960s, with the vicious backlash against the counter-culture, all further research was banned. In recent years, however, work has quietly begun again on the amazing potential of LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Could these drugs in fact improve the lives of many people? Diving deep into this extraordinary world and putting himself forward as a guinea-pig, Michael Pollan has written a remarkable history of psychedelics and a compelling portrait of the new generation of scientists fascinated by the implications of these drugs.
